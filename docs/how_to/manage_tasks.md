# Manage Tasks

An important step in the user's workflow is monitoring/managing tasks. Whether
the user is simply trying to follow the progress of a simulation, retrieve results,
or even kill a task, the `Task` class provides the necessary tools to do so.
In this section, we will cover the following topics:

 * [Task monitoring](#task-monitoring): Learn how to monitor a task, such as
   getting its status and getting information about the outputs;
 * [Killing tasks](#killing-tasks): Learn how to kill a task that hasn't
   been completed yet;
 * [Downloading Outputs](#downloading-outputs): Learn how to download the
   outputs of a task.

## Task monitoring

The `Task` class provides mechanisms to track and manage the status of a task.
With a `Task` object at hand, the user can:
 * Get the status, i.e., whether the task is started, succeeded, failed, etc
 (see the section about [task lifecycle](../explore_api/tasks#task-lifecycle.md)
 for more details);
 * Get the machine type where it ran/is running;
 * Get the execution time.

The following snippets show how to use the `Task` class to manage a task.

```python
# create a new task or retrieve a task from a previous session
# task = simulator.run(...)
#   or 
# task = Task("i4ir3kvv62odsfrhko4y8w2an")

# Get status of the task.
>>> task.get_status()
<DynamicSchema: 'success'>

# Get the computational resource type where the task is
# running or was submitted to
>>> task.get_machine_type()
'c2-standard-4'

>>> task.get_computation_time()
'00:03:12'

# Get information about the output files generated by the simulation
>>> output_files_info = task.get_output_files_info()
>>> print(output_files_info)

Other than just retrieving information about the task, the user has the option
to control 


## Killing tasks

Sometimes, a user finds out that there is a reason to not allow a task to reach
a final state. Whether there is a mistake in the simulation input files, a
running simulation has gone rogue, or simply because there is no other reason
to allow a task to proceed, the user can kill a task. The `Task` class provides
a method to kill a task that hasn't been completed yet. Tasks in the
`PENDING INPUT`, `SUBMITTED` and `STARTED` states can be killed (see the section
on [task lifecycle](../introduction/tasks#task-lifecycle)).

To kill a task programmatically, one has 2 options at hand: by declaratively
calling the `kill` method or interrupting the python session/script
when a task is being waited in the context of a `sync_context` call:

```python
# grab a task object and
# declaratively emit a kill command
>>> task = Task("i4ir3kvv62odsfrhko4y8w2an")
>>> task.kill()

# or interrupt the session while waiting for the task to complete
>>> with tak.sync_context():
        task.wait()  # <-- The remote simulation WILL DIE if the local session is
                     #     interrupted while waiting for the wait() call to return
                     #     (Ex. the user presses Ctrl+C)

```

Alternatively, the user can resort to the command line interface to kill the task:

```bash
$ inductiva tasks kill i4ir3kvv62odsfrhko4y8w2an
You are about to kill the following tasks:
  - i4ir3kvv62odsfrhko4y8w2an
Are you sure you want to proceed (y/[N])? y
Successfully sent kill request for task i4ir3kvv62odsfrhko4y8w2an.
```
