# API access tokens

To use Inductiva API you will need a valid API token. At the moment, you can 
request an API token [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflytIIwzaBE_ZzoRloVm3uTo1OQCH6Cqhw3bhFVnC61s7Wmw/viewform). 

Once you have your API token, you can set the `INDUCTIVA_API_KEY` as
an environment variable in your terminal as follows:

```bash
export INDUCTIVA_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You are good to go! You can start exploring Inductiva API with the examples below.
