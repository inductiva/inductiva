# Uninstall the `inductiva` package

Whether you just want a completely new installation of `inductiva` or
whether you decided that, as it turns out, the package is not for you,
we understand and would like to thank you for having given it a
go. Either way we would like to give you instructions on how to
completely remove traces of `inductiva` from your system.

First you should remove it using:

```shell
pip uninstall inductiva
```

Next, recall that the inductiva package, writes locally to your
disc. Therefore you should have a folder under `$HOME/.inductiva` in
your system. Remove it. You are good to go!
