# Overview

Inductiva API has available several open-source simulators ready to use. Users 
who are familiar with the simulators can easily start running simulations with 
their previously prepared simulation configuration files. 

As described in the [configuring simulators section](../explore_api/configuring-simulators.md) typical usage patterns involve:
- [Single executable simulator;](../explore_api/configuring-simulators#the-simple-cases.md)
- [Pre-defined executables running in sequence;](../explore_api/configuring-simulators#a-slightly-more-complex-case.md)
- [Choose the executables as wished to run in sequence.](../explore_api/configuring-simulators#running-long-simulation-pipelines.md)

The simulators available in the current version of the API (0.4) are:
- [DualSPHysics](../simulators/DualSPHysics.md)
- [SPlisHSPlasH](../simulators/SPlisHSPlasH.md)
- [OpenFOAM](../simulators/OpenFOAM.md)
- [GROMACS](../simulators/GROMACS.md)
- [SWASH](../simulators/SWASH.md)
- [XBeach](../simulators/XBeach.md)
- [Reef3D](../simulators/Reef3D.md)
- [SWAN](../simulators/SWAN.md)
- [FDS](../simulators/FDS.md)

Check the documentation of each simulator to learn about the specifics of how to configure them and launch your simulations via the API.

If you have any questions or suggestions about other open-source simulation packages
that you would like to see available via Inductiva API, please open an issue on
our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/issues), or contact us via [support@inductiva.ai](mailto:support@inductiva.ai).
