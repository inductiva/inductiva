# Overview

Inductiva API has available several open-source simulators ready to use. Users 
who are familiar with the simulators can easily start running simulations with 
their previously prepared simulation configuration files. 

As described in our [Tutorial](https://tutorials.staging.inductiva.ai/intro_to_api/configuring-simulators.html)
typical usage patterns involve:
- [Single executable simulator;](https://tutorials.staging.inductiva.ai/intro_to_api/configuring-simulators.html#the-simple-cases)
- [Pre-defined executables running in sequence;](https://tutorials.staging.inductiva.ai/intro_to_api/configuring-simulators.html#a-slightly-more-complex-case)
- [Choose the executables as wished to run in sequence.](https://tutorials.staging.inductiva.ai/intro_to_api/configuring-simulators.html#running-long-simulation-pipelines)

The simulators available in the current version of the API (0.7) are:
- [Amr-Wind](../simulators/AmrWind.md)
- [CaNS](../simulators/CaNS.md)
- [DualSPHysics](../simulators/DualSPHysics.md)
- [FDS](../simulators/FDS.md)
- [GROMACS](../simulators/GROMACS.md)
- [OpenFOAM](../simulators/OpenFOAM.md)
- [OpenFAST](../simulators/OpenFAST.md)
- [Reef3D](../simulators/Reef3D.md)
- [SCHISM](../simulators/SCHISM.md)
- [SPlisHSPlasH](../simulators/SPlisHSPlasH.md)
- [SWAN](../simulators/SWAN.md)
- [SWASH](../simulators/SWASH.md)
- [XBeach](../simulators/XBeach.md)

Check the documentation of each simulator to learn about the specifics
of how to configure them and launch your simulations via the API.

If you have any questions or suggestions about other open-source simulation
packages that you would like to see available via Inductiva API, please
