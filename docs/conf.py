# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'Project'
copyright = '2022, Inductiva Research Labs'
author = 'Inductiva Research Labs'

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# The suffix(es) of source filenames.
# Note: important to list ipynb before md here: we have both md and ipynb
# copies of each notebook, and myst will choose which to convert based on
# the order in the source_suffix list. Notebooks which are not executed have
# outputs stored in ipynb but not in md, so we must convert the ipynb.
source_suffix = ['.rst', '.ipynb', '.md']

# The main toctree document.
main_doc = 'index'

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = []

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
