# Overview

The Inductiva Command Line Interface (CLI) offers a streamlined and efficient way 
to interact with our platform directly from your terminal. Designed for ease of use, 
the CLI enables you to manage simulations, resources, and data in real-time, even 
while your simulations run in the cloud.

The power of the Inductiva CLI lies in its simplicity â€”just a command away: 
```bash
inductiva
```
Now, you can choose from a list of available commands to run via the Inductiva (CLI) to manage your projects and interact with our API:

````{eval-rst}
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: `resources`

      List and manage your computational resources.

   .. tab:: `tasks`

      Create and manage your simulation tasks.

   .. tab:: `logs`

      Access real-time logs for ongoing tasks.

   .. tab:: `storage`

      Get an overview of your remote storage.

````

For detailed information on any command, you can always use the `--help` or `-h` flag 
to further understand its usage:

```bash
inductiva --help
```
