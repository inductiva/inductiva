# Inductiva: a Python package for scaling simulations on the Cloud

Welcome to the official Python library for the Inductiva API version 0.5 
The Inductiva API allows running a set of open-source physical
simulators on the cloud, easily parallelizing simulations, each running
on hundreds of CPU cores.

Inductiva simplifies the complexities of cloud resource management, and software
configuration, offering a straightforward Python interface for running simulations
on state-of-the-art hardware. This allows scientists and engineers to focus their
time and energy on what matters: running simulations that solve real problems.

This documentation includes:
- A [Getting started](get_started/installation.md) guide that will help you set up the Inductiva
API client, and run your first simulation within only a few minutes;
- An [Explore the API section](explore_api/how_it_works.md) where we will give
you a comprehensive overview of how the API works, explaining key concepts and how
different components play together;
- A [How-To section](how_to/run-parallel_simulations.md) where we will guide you through several common tasks, and which
provides practical examples for you to try;
- A [list of the various open-source simulation packages](simulators/index.md) that you can invoke via the
API (if you have suggestions for adding more simulation packages, please let us know
by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/issues));
- A guide on [Inductiva’s Command Line Interface (CLI)](cli/cli-overview.md), which
allows you to perform many tasks from your terminal, including listing available
computational resources and checking the status of tasks;
- A User Reference section that covers a wide variety of topics of interest, including
information about some key classes available in the API Client, a troubleshooting guide,
information about quotas and an FAQ.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the API please [open an issue on the inductiva’s API Client GitHub repo](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/issues), or contact us via [support@inductiva.ai](mailto:support@inductiva.ai).
