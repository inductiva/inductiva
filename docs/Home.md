# Welcome to Inductiva API

Inductiva is a Python package for executing large-scale simulations of physical 
systems directly in the cloud.

Inductiva API offers distinct advantages:

- 🔄 It consolidates various simulation domains, including fluid and molecular 
dynamics, plasmas, and structural mechanics, under a single unified entry point.
- 📦 Eliminates the need for installing and managing complex simulation software 
and corresponding dependencies.
- 🚀 Allows running hundreds or even thousands of simulations concurrently, with 
no coding.
- 💽 Automatically optimizes hardware configurations for each type of simulation 
(e.g., CPU vs. GPU, appropriate number of CPU cores, RAM, etc.).
- 🐍 With Inductiva API, you are not limited to a pre-defined GUI or intricate 
configuration languages and scripts. Instead, you write small Python programs 
that seamlessly integrate with your existing codebase and ML framework.
