# Inductiva: a Python package for scaling simulations on the Cloud

Welcome to the official Python library for the Inductiva API version **0.4.4**. 
The Inductiva API allows running a set of open-source physical
simulators on the cloud, easily parallelizing simulations, each running
on hundreds of CPU cores.

Inductiva simplifies the complexities of cloud resource management, and software
configuration, offering a straightforward Python interface for running simulations
on state-of-the-art hardware. This allows scientists and engineers to focus their
time and energy on what matters: running simulations that solve real problems.

To find out more, check our [documentation](https://inductiva-research-labs-inductiva.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).


If you have any questions or suggestions about the API please [open an issue on the inductiva’s API Client GitHub repo](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/issues), or contact us via [support@inductiva.ai](mailto:support@inductiva.ai).
