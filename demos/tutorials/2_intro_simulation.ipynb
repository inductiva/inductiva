In this way, users can immediatelly take advantage of accelerated hardware to speed up their simulations, without having to change any of their existing simulation scripts. \n","\n","Still, most users want to execute more than just one simulation. In fact, users may need to explore the design space of a given simulation scenario to evaluate the impact of varying some design parameters. Inductiva API provides a simple mechanism for helping users perform large scale parameter exploration, starting from a base simulation script. The only thing that is required is to substitute in the simulation script the fixed numerical values of the parameters to explore with user defined tags. This will indicate the API engine that we want to vary these parameters over a range of values defined by the user. This way, users can introduce variations in their simulations with minor effort, and immediately benefit from efficient parallelization strategies to explore the design space of the simulation scenario at scale.\n","\n","In this tutorial we will show such parameter exploration capabilities on a coastal dynamics scenario, powered by the [SWASH](https://swash.sourceforge.io/download/download.htm) simulation package. SWASH simulates unsteady and free-surface flow and transport phenomena in coastal waters as driven by waves, tides, buoyancy and wind forces. It provides a general basis for describing wave transformations from deep water to a beach, port or harbour, complex changes to rapidly varied flows, and density driven flows in coastal seas, estuaries, lakes and rivers.\n","\n","<!-- An example of the outputs of this simulation is provided below, where we are simulating the addition of a break water to minimize the effects of the waves on shore. [Ivan: is this what the tutorial is about? Let's add figures that are related with this tutorial. You don't have to do it now :)... But I think it is important to show something that the users will relate to. It could be the map of the batymetry plus some extra image we get of the simulation for T=30s]. -->\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yPRhWpmSjZ11"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","The two notebooks below will help you understand how all this works.\n","\n","Let's get started!\n","\n","\n","- **Part 1:** [Execute a simulation starting from a previously prepared configuration file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11rvRgKtW-Mg8vrg1TDH93P9T8U0osnow)\n","- **Part 2:** [Generalize configuration file to perform parameter exploration at scale](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LoCaHmGwQDwSlQC-CUrnhEC1KIpMhqlk)"],"metadata":{"id":"kjeOhiWdG_Vv"}}]}
