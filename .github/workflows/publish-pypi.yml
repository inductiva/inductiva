# Workflow that publishes package to PyPI.
# The workflow is triggered on push of a tag that starts with "v", e.g. v0.3.0.
# The workflow will build the package and then publish it to PyPI. Note that the
# version specified in the tag is not the used for the package version on PyPI.
# The version used is the one specified in the package's setup.cfg file. Ensure
# that the version specified in the setup.cfg file in the repository is the
# same used in the tag that triggers the workflow for consistency between the
# repository and the published package.
