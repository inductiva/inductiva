# XBeach on Inductiva
In **Episode 1** of our webinar series *Run It with Inductiva.AI*, we show how **Inductiva** 
makes it easy to run complex XBeach simulations — no infrastructure setup required, 
just scalable performance.

From modeling coastal erosion to predicting storm impacts, see how researchers and engineers are accelerating their work with Inductiva’s integrated simulation workflows.

💡 **What you’ll learn**:
- Why integrate XBeach with Inductiva? (*Scalability, ease of use, and efficiency*)
- Live demo: Running XBeach on the Inductiva platform
- Tips, performance metrics, and real-world applications
- Q&A and next steps to get started
