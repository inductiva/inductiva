# XBeach on Inductiva
In **Episode 1** of our webinar series *Run It with Inductiva.AI*, we show how **Inductiva** 
makes it easy to run complex XBeach simulations — no infrastructure setup required, 
just scalable performance.

From modeling coastal erosion to predicting storm impacts, see how researchers and engineers are accelerating their work with Inductiva’s integrated simulation workflows.

💡 **What you’ll learn**:
- How to run XBeach simulations on Inductiva.AI
- Live demo on the platform
- Q&A / Next Steps
