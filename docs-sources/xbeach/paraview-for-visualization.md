# XBeach Visualizations with ParaView
This tutorial guides you through creating a visualization in ParaView using simulation results from XBeach.

As an example, we use the `DELILAH` field experiment, which is also featured in the [official XBeach documentation](https://xbeach.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#field-experiment-delilah).

## Prerequisites
Download the necessary input files from this [link](https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/xbeach/skillbed/input/Delilah_199010131000/). 

## Adjust Simulation Parameters
To automatically generate the XBeach visualization at the end of your DELILAH simulation, ensure that the following variables exist in the `params_original.txt` input file, or modify them accordingly:

* `outputformat = netcdf` - ensures XBeach exports the results in NetCDF format.
* `single_dir = 0` - required for XBeach v10+; add this just after the header.
* **Global output block** - provides the wave height (`H`), free-surface level (`zs`), and bed level (`zb`) required by the visualization script. Copy the following lines exactly as shown:

```
nglobalvar = 3
H
zs
zb
```

* `tintg = 5` - sets how often XBeach writes the global variables. A low value like `5` generates enough frames for smooth animation 
without producing excessively large files.

## Running the DELILAH case
Below is the script to run the DELILAH case using the Inductiva API. The simulation is configured to export results in .vtk format using the `export_vtk` flag, making them compatible with ParaView for visualization. This example typically takes around 4 minutes on the specified cloud machine.

```python
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup(
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-16",
    spot=True)

# Set simulation input directory
input_dir = "Path/to/Delilah_199010131000"

# Initialize the Simulator
xbeach = inductiva.simulators.XBeach()

# Run simulation
task = xbeach.run(
    input_dir=input_dir,
    sim_config_filename="params_original.txt",
    on=cloud_machine,
    project="xbeach",
    export_vtk=True, # Flag to enable VTK output for visualization
)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
task.download_outputs()

cloud_machine.terminate()

task.print_summary()
```

At the end of the run, the simulation will be complete, and the results will be downloaded to the `inductiva_output` folder on your local machine.

## Visualizing the Results with ParaView
When the `export_vtk` flag is set to `True`, a VTK folder will be created inside the `inductiva_output` directory. This folder contains two groups of VTK files: 

1. `seabed.vtk` - a single, static mesh representing the seabed.
2. `wave_..vtk` - a time series of .vtk files containing water-surface data at each `tintg` interval. 

Visualizing your simulation with ParaView is simple:

First, open ParaView and go to the menu `File` > `Open...`. Navigate to your
simulation results folder, then to `VTK/`, and select both Groups named `seabed.vtk`, and `wave_..vtk`.

Once all files are loaded, make them visible by clicking the **eye** icon in the **Pipeline Browser** 
on the left side of the screen.

Next, position your camera by clicking the `set view direction +X` button in the toolbar.

![Move the camera to the correct position](./_static/camera.png)

Now you can press the **Play** button in the toolbar to watch your simulation run in real time.

You can save your animation by going to **File > Save Animation...** and choosing your preferred format.

That's it! Youâ€™ve completed the full workflow: from running an XBeach simulation using the DELILAH case to visualizing the results 
in ParaView.
