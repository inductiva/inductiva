## About XBeach
[XBeach](https://oss.deltares.nl/web/xbeach/) is a powerful two-dimensional simulator designed for modeling wave propagation, sediment transport, and morphological changes in nearshore areas. It is widely used in coastal engineering to predict how shorelines evolve under the influence of waves, tides, and currents, making it an essential tool for erosion studies, coastal protection projects, and environmental impact assessments.

## Supported Versions
Inductiva stays up to date with the latest versions of XBeach. Below is a list of the supported versions:

- **1.24** 
- **1.23** 

To use a specific XBeach version, simply specify it when initializing the simulator:

## Container Images
Each version of XBeach in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=xbeach), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/xbeach).
