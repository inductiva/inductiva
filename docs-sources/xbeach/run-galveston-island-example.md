## Objective
The goal is to demonstrate how to run the `Galveston Island` use case from the [GRIIDC repository](https://data.griidc.org/data/HI.x833.000:0001) - a research data platform from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christiâ€™s Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies.

## Prerequisites
1. Download the dataset titled "XBeach model setup and results for beach and dune enhancement scenarios on Galveston Island, Texas", available [here](https://data.griidc.org/data/HI.x833.000:0001#individual-files).
2. Navigate to **Files >> XBeach_Model_Runs >> Beach_Nourish_Only >> Input** and download *all* the files in this directory.
3. Save the downloaded files in a local folder named `Beach_Nourish_Only`, maintaining this directory structure:

```

```

## Adjust Simulation Parameters
To reduce simulation time, update the `params.txt` file with the following changes:
- Add `single_dir = 0` just after the header (required for XBeach v10+).
- Set `tstop` to `34560` to shorten the simulation duration.

## Run Your Simulation
Below is the code required to run the simulation using the Inductiva API.

In this example, we use a `c2d-highcpu-56` cloud machine featuring 56 virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and a 20 GB data disk.

```python
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup(
	provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-56",
    data_disk_gb=20,
    spot=True,)

# Initialize the Simulator
xbeach = inductiva.simulators.XBeach( \
    version="1.24")

# Run simulation 
task = xbeach.run(
    input_dir="Beach_Nourish_Only",
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

> **Note**: Setting `spot=True` enables the use of [spot machines](../how-it-works/machines/spot-machines.md), which are available at substantial discounts. 
> However, your simulation may be interrupted if the cloud provider reclaims the machine.

When the simulation is complete, we terminate the machine, download the results and print a summary of the simulation as shown below.

```
Task status: Success

```

As you can see in the "In Progress" line, the part of the timeline that represents the actual execution of the simulation, 
the core computation time of this simulation was approximately 1 hour and 17 minutes.

## Upgrading to Powerful Machines
One of Inductivaâ€™s key advantages is how easily you can scale your simulations to larger, more powerful machines with minimal code changes. Scaling up simply requires updating the `machine_type` parameter when allocating your cloud machine.

You can upgrade to a next-generation cloud machine, increase the number of vCPUs, or do both!

For example, running the simulation on a machine with more vCPUs, such as the `c2d-highcpu-112`, reduces computation time from 1 hour and 17 minutes to approximately **47 minutes**, with a modest cost increase to US$0.48.

Itâ€™s that simple! ðŸš€
