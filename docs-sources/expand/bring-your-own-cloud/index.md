# Guide to Bringing Your Own Cloud

## Get started
Inductiva lets you connect your own cloud provider account, namely to export simulation 
files directly to your own AWS S3 bucket.  
While full Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) compute is not currently supported, this export 
feature is a first step toward deeper integration with your own infrastructure.

**[Export files to AWS →](export-files-to-aws/index.md):** This guide streamlines transfering files to an AWS S3 account.  
 

## Why it's Useful
✓ **Use your own cloud credits:** Easily move data from Inductiva to your existing storage workflows.

✓ **Data control and compliance:** Meet internal policies by keeping data within your own cloud account.

✓ **Smooth integration:** Simplifies integration with downstream processes or pipelines hosted on AWS.
