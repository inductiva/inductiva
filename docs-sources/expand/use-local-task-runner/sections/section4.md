# Why Use the Local Task-Runner?
Using the local task-runner provides the following key benefits:
- **Cost Savings**: Run simulations for free on your local machine; storage is the only associated cost.
- **Scalability**: Add multiple computers to your machine group to boost computational capacity.
- **Ease of Management**: Use the Inductiva CLI to manage and monitor tasks with minimal effort.


By following this tutorial, you can efficiently use the local task-runner to execute simulations at a small scale while while keeping costs low. After you validate that your simulation is producing the intended results, you can scale up using state-of-the-art [cloud computational resources](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource).
