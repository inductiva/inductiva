# Creating a Python Dockerfile for Inductiva

With **Inductiva**, you can run your own software using custom Docker images,
just like in [this example](./integrate-your-docker-container.md).

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll guide you through a few simple steps to run your Python
code on the cloud with Inductiva.

You will start by creating your own **Dockerfile** that builds into a Docker
image containing your Python environment (with all the libraries you need).  
After that, weâ€™ll build the image and send it to Inductiva so you can run your
code in the cloud.

This image will be **available only to you**, and no other users will have access to it.


## Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Start from Ubuntu base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python packages
RUN pip install --break-system-packages <all other packages you need>

# Set python3 as the default python
RUN update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
```

In this Dockerfile, you will only need to replace `<all other packages you need>` with the
Python packages you want to install.
Example:

```dockerfile
RUN pip3 install --break-system-packages numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image you just need to run the following command in the same
directory where your Dockerfile is located:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-image --platform linux/amd64 .
```

> **Note**: You can replace `my-python-image` with any name you prefer for your image. The `--platform linux/amd64` flag ensures compatibility with Inductiva's infrastructure, which currently supports only `linux/amd64` images.

## Running the Docker Image on Inductiva
Now that you have your Docker image ready you just need to upload it to Inductiva
with the following command:

```bash
inductiva containers upload my-python-image
```

This command will upload your Docker image to Inductiva, making it available for
you to run simulations using this image.

## Running Your Code
To run your Python code using the Docker image you just uploaded, you can use the
following code snippet:

```python
import inductiva

machine_group = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup(
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c3d-highcpu-16",
    data_disk_gb=20,
    spot=True)

python_image = inductiva.simulators.CustomImage(
    container_image="inductiva://my-containers/my-python-image.sif")


task = python_image.run(
    input_dir="/Users/paulobarbosa/Downloads/empty",
    commands=[
        'python -c "import pandas as pd"',
        'python -c "import numpy as np"'],
    on=machine_group)

task.wait()
machine_group.terminate()

task.download_outputs()
```

It is this simple! You can now run your Python code on the cloud using your
custom Docker image. The `input_dir` parameter can be set to any directory on your
local machine with your python scripts and data files.

Happy simulations! ðŸš€
