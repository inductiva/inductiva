# Guide to Bringing Your Own Software
Inductiva is a versatile API platform that simplifies the process of running a wide variety of pre-configured simulation software. With its flexible architecture, Inductiva can also be adapted to run **any scientific software**, making it a powerful tool for researchers and developers.

A key feature of Inductiva is its support for **custom Apptainer images** (formerly Singularity). This allows you to package and upload any software your project requires. Once uploaded, these images can be seamlessly deployed on cloud GPUs, enabling high-performance computing at scale with minimal setup. 

To help you get started and make the most of Inductiva's capabilities, we've created a series of tutorials. These guides are designed to walk you through setting up and running different types of scientific software, giving you the tools and knowledge you need to succeed.

> **Note**: This feature is available exclusively with Inductiva's **Enterprise** 
plan and also included in our **Academia** subscription. For full details, 
please visit our [Pricing](https://inductiva.ai/pricing) page.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch the Episode
In **Episode 5** of our webinar series *Run It with Inductiva.AI*, we show how to run large-scale, high-performance simulations on the cloud, directly from your laptop, using simple Python scripts.

üí° **What you‚Äôll learn**:
- How to use Inductiva‚Äôs Python interface to run scientific computing workflows
- Hands-on simulation examples across selected domains in engineering and science
- Pointers to more examples on scaling simulations and solving related tasks, such as generating synthetic data to train Physics-AI models
- Q&A / Next Steps
