The Expand section showcases how Inductiva gives you the freedom to tailor the 
platform to your specific needs. Whether you're working with custom code, 
private infrastructure, or an existing cloud provider, this section guides you 
through extending Inductiva’s capabilities with your own tools. You’ll learn how 
to run your own software in the cloud, connect external compute resources, or 
integrate your current cloud account — all while keeping the simplicity of 
Inductiva’s API and workflow.  

## 📘 What’s Inside:
🧩 [Bring your own software](bring-your-own-software/index.md) – Run your custom 
code on Inductiva with containerized environments.  

🖥️ [Bring your own hardware](use-local-task-runner/index.md) – Connect and use your 
own machines with Inductiva’s platform.  

☁️ [Bring your own cloud](bring-your-own-cloud/index) – Link your existing cloud 
account and run simulations there seamlessly.  


## 💡 Why It’s Useful:
✓ **Full flexibility:** Use your own simulation code and containerized environments.  

✓ **Leverage private infrastructure:** Run simulations on on-prem or custom machines.  

✓ **Integrate with your cloud:** Use your existing cloud credits or setup.  

✓ **Keep control:** Customize environments while keeping access control and reproducibility.  

✓ **Scale beyond limits:** Overcome quota or cost constraints by bringing your own compute.
