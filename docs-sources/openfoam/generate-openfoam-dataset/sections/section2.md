# Run a Single Simulation
First, we will run a single OpenFOAM simulation using the `motorBike` 
case. This should be straightforward as all the necessary input files are 
already prepared, as described in the previous section.

## Code Overview
The Python code required to run a OpenFOAM simulation using the Inductiva API follows a consistent structure. We adapt it for this specific use case, as shown below.


```python
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-32",
    spot=True)

# Initialize OpenFOAM stack
openfoam = inductiva.simulators.OpenFOAM()

task = openfoam.run( \
    input_dir="input_files/",
    shell_script="./Allrun",
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

When the simulation is complete, we terminate the machine, download the results and print a summary of the simulation as shown as follows.

```
Task status: Success

In the next part of this tutorial, we'll take things to the next level by running dozens of OpenFOAM simulations in parallel on Inductiva, demonstrating the true power of cloud-based scalability. Stay tuned!
