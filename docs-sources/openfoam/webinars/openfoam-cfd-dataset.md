# Run It with Inductiva.AI - Episode 3 / Generating a CFD dataset

In this episode we show how you can use Inductiva to generate an OpenFOAM
dataset super easily.  If you already know OpenFOAM, the extra complexity is
less than 20 lines of Python code!

* **What to expect**
    - Introduction & motivation behind ML models for CFD
    - Running one OpenFOAM simulation on Inductiva
    - Generating a dataset
    - Q&A / Next Steps
