# Generating a CFD Dataset
In **Episode 3** of our webinar series *Run It with Inductiva.AI*,  we show how you can generate an 
OpenFOAM dataset easily using **Inductiva’s cloud-based HPC platform**. If you're already familiar 
with OpenFOAM, the additional setup takes fewer than 20 lines of Python.

💡 **What You’ll Learn**:
- Introduction and motivation behind Machine Learning models for CFD
- Live demo: Running OpenFOAM on the Inductiva platform
- Generating a full dataset
- Q&A and next steps to get started
