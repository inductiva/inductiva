<h3>About OpenFOAM</h3>

OpenFOAM is an open-source C++ toolbox designed for the development of custom numerical solvers and pre- and post-processing utilities. It is widely used for solving a variety of continuum mechanics problems, including computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, electromagnetism, and multiphase flow.

Inductiva supports both OpenFOAM distributions: [ESI Group](https://www.openfoam.com/about-esi-opencfd) and [OpenFOAM Foundation](https://openfoam.org/), giving you access to the full range of OpenFOAM capabilities.
