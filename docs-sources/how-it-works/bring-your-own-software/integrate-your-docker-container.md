# Integrate Your Docker Container
One of Inductiva's standout features is its ability to seamlessly run any Docker container directly in the cloud. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through the integration process using [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org) as an example. This approach can also be applied to your **own custom Docker images**.

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll know how to:
- Use a standard Docker image (FFMPEG)
- Upload it to Inductivaâ€™s container registry
- Run it in the cloud with scalable compute

Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Pull the Docker Image
You can use any Docker image from Docker Hub or your own private registry. For this guide, we will use a pre-built FFMPEG image, a widely-used tool for media processing. To get started, run the following command:

```
docker pull linuxserver/ffmpeg --platform linux/amd64
```

## Step 2: Upload to Inductiva
Uploading Docker images to Inductiva is simple â€” just **one command**. When you upload your image, it will automatically be converted into the [Singularity Image Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software)) (.sif), which is commonly used in high-performance computing for its portability and security.

To upload your image, run:

```bash
inductiva containers upload linuxserver/ffmpeg
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use `inductiva containers list` to verify the containers youâ€™ve uploaded.

## Step 3: Run It in the Cloud
Once your container is uploaded, you can use it for cloud-based tasks just like any native Inductiva simulator.

Letâ€™s say you want to run a video processing command that reverses and negates the frames of a video while also reversing the audio. Hereâ€™s the command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'reverse, negate' -af areverse output.mp4
```

Copy and execute the following Python script to run this remotely on the cloud using the Inductiva API:

```python
import inductiva

# Define the machine group
machine_group = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup(
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-8",
    spot=True,
)

# Define your simulator using the uploaded container
ffmpeg = inductiva.simulators.CustomImage(
    container_image="inductiva://my-containers/ffmpeg.sif"
)

# Run the task
task = ffmpeg.run(
    input_dir="input",  # folder containing 'input.mp4'
    commands=[
        "ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'reverse, negate' -af areverse output.mp4"
    ],
    on=machine_group,
)

# Wait for it to complete and download the result
task.wait()
task.download_outputs()

# Clean up your resources
machine_group.terminate()
```

> **Note**: Ensure that the `input_dir` includes your `input.mp4` file and the processed video will be saved as output.mp4.

## Why Choose Inductiva for Your Docker Workflows
Inductiva streamlines the process of running Docker containers in the cloud, and hereâ€™s why itâ€™s the ideal solution::
- **No changes required to your application**: Just upload your Docker image and you're ready to go
- **No manual VM setup**: Inductiva handles everything automatically.
- **Run any container**: From media processing tools like FFMPEG to PyTorch or custom AI tools.

Whether youâ€™re processing videos, running simulations, or deploying research tools, Inductiva simplifies the process of scaling your Docker workflows to the cloud â€” without the hassle.
