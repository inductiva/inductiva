# The Inductiva Guide to Bringing Your Own Software
Inductiva is a versatile API platform that simplifies the process of running a wide variety of pre-configured simulation software. With its flexible architecture, Inductiva can also be adapted to run **any scientific software**, making it a powerful tool for researchers and developers.

A key feature of Inductiva is its support for **custom Apptainer images** (formerly Singularity). This allows you to package and upload any software your project requires. Once uploaded, these images can be seamlessly deployed on cloud GPUs, enabling high-performance computing at scale with minimal setup. 

To help you get started and make the most of Inductiva's capabilities, we've created a series of tutorials. These guides are designed to walk you through setting up and running different types of scientific software, giving you the tools and knowledge you need to succeed.

> **Note**: This feature is available exclusively with Inductiva's **Enterprise** 
plan and also included in our **Academia** subscription. For full details, 
please visit our [Pricing](https://inductiva.ai/pricing) page.
