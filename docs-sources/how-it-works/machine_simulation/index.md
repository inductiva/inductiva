## Why it's Important

✓ **Avoid over-provisioning** Choose machines with the right amount of CPU, memory, and storage to avoid paying for unused resources while ensuring your simulations run smoothly.

✓ **Maximize performance** Match your simulation's computational patterns with machine architectures that excel at those specific workloads, whether compute-intensive, memory-intensive, or GPU-accelerated.

✓ **Optimize costs** Use data-driven insights to select cost-effective machine configurations, leverage spot pricing when appropriate, and avoid trial-and-error expenses.

✓ **Scale intelligently** Understand how different machine specifications affect simulation performance to make informed decisions when scaling up your computational demands.

✓ **Learn from experience** Use post-simulation metrics to continuously improve your machine selection and resource allocation for future runs.
