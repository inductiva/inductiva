# Cloud Storage

## Get started
☁️ Get clarity on how Inductiva handles simulation data, where task outputs live, 
how to access and manage them, and why storage choices impact your credit usage. 
Learn best practices for organizing and cleaning up data.

[Storage and Data Flow](cloud-storage) - Learn about Local Storage, Personal 
Remote Storage and Worker Storage, and how they all connect.

## Why it's Useful
* Store everything in one place – Every user gets a private cloud bucket to hold 
simulation inputs and outputs securely.
* Keep your data organized – Understand how storage is linked to projects and tasks, 
so you never lose track of your results.
* Control your storage costs – Learn how to monitor usage and clean up unnecessary 
files to avoid surprises.
* Automate and manage easily – Upload, download, or delete files efficiently across 
your simulations.
* No time limits – Your data stays available as long as you need it - no automatic 
deletion, no expiration deadlines.
