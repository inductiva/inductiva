# How many cores can I use in Inductiva?

Inductiva provides access to hundreds of cutting-edge cloud machines and empowers the user to select the best option for their simulation use-case.

These machines cover a wide range of specifications, including the number of vCPUs, and provide you with options at different levels of performance and cost.

If a single machine isnâ€™t sufficient, the user can combine resources from multiple machines to handle their simulation. For example, a user can allocate two machines with 360 vCPUs each, granting them access to 720 vCPUs.

ðŸ’¡**Inductiva's top pick**: the c2d-highcpu-112 machine. 
It has 112 vCPUs and 224GB of RAM, providing an impressive cost/performance ratio (price around 4.62 US\$/hour and spot price of just ~0.68 US\$/hour).
