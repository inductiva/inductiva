|---|---|---|
| Get a concrete sense of how far the initial free credits can take you, with examples of simulations and runtimes covered by $5US. | Understand how simulation costs are calculated, including machine pricing, storage usage, and tips to stay cost-efficient. | Learn about the limits in place for each user account, how they help ensure a reliable experience for everyone, and how to request increases if needed. |


## Why it's Useful
âœ“ **Plan your simulation budget confidently** â€” Understand exactly how far your credits go and what 
affects your spending.

âœ“ **Choose the right resources for your needs** â€” Match your simulations to the most cost-efficient 
machines and core configurations. 

âœ“ **Avoid unexpected interruptions** â€” Get clarity on platform limits (quotas) to prevent your tasks 
from being blocked or delayed.

âœ“ **Scale responsibly** â€” Learn how to make the most of your available resources and when to request 
an upgrade. 

âœ“ **Make smarter decisions** â€” Transparent cost and quota info helps you optimize both performance 
and spending.
