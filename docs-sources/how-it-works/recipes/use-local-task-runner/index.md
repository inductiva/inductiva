# How to Use the Local Task-Runner
The local task-runner allows you to execute simulations on your own computer. This is especially useful for testing and running simulations at minimal cost. Since you’re using local computational resources, the only charges come from cloud storage used to save simulation inputs and results for future access.

## What You'll Learn
In this guide, you’ll learn how to:
- Launch the local task-runner using Docker
- Add your computer to a machine group
- Configure and run simulations locally
- Manage the local task-runner

## Prerequisites 
Before getting started, make sure the following are installed on your computer:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Inductiva Python package (`pip install inductiva`)
- Inductiva Python package with Task-Runner support (`pip install inductiva[task-runner]`)
