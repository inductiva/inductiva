# üóëÔ∏è Clean Up Storage by Condition

As you run more simulations on Inductiva, storage used by failed, outdated, or large tasks can accumulate quickly, potentially increasing costs and cluttering your project space. This guide shows you how to identify and clean up unnecessary storage by:

* [Deleting failed](sections/delete-failed-tasks.md)
* [Deleting old tasks](sections/delete-old-tasks.md)
* [Cleaning up storage for entire projects](sections/delete-project-tasks.md)
* [Downloading outputs before deletion](sections/download-and-delete.md)
* [Identifying tasks that use the most storage](sections/find-large-tasks.md)

Each section provides a code snippet to help you manage your storage effectively and keep your workspace organized.
