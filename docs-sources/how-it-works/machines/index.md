# Resources
The Inductiva API provides on-demand access to computational infrastructure for running your simulations at any scale. Resources are automatically provisioned and managed, so you can focus on your simulations rather than infrastructure management.

## Get started
Learn about _Resources_—the core entity in the Inductiva API that executes your simulations. Resources can be cloud machines, your personal computer, or dedicated hardware, all managed through our API that handles its allocation, scaling, and monitoring automatically.

      Learn about the anatomy of a Resource and how it works.

   .. grid-item-card:: Set up Resources
      :link: setup-resources

- **Resources**: Learn how to choose beteween the dedicated resources made available by our API, and understand when each option provides the best value for your specific use case
- **Computational Infrastructure**: Understand the diverse computational options available, from cloud machines to your own laptop, and understand how the API simplifies the access to these computing infrastructure

Whether you're running a single simulation or orchestrating thousands of simulations, this guide will help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and maximize the efficiency of your computational workflows.

## Features
✓ **Launch resources instantly** Automatically allocate and configure compute infrastructure. No need to manually set up instances or manage infrastructure.

✓ **Scale dynamically** Scale your computational resources up or down based on your simulation demands. Handle everything from single simulations to thousands of parallel jobs seamlessly.

✓ **Run anywhere** Execute simulations on cloud infrastructure, dedicated servers, or your own hardware. Switch between different environments without changing your code.

✓ **Handle machine preemptions** Automatically detect and recover from machine preemptions. Interrupted simulations are restarted on other machines without manual intervention.

✓ **Control costs** Get transparent pricing of resource usage and costs.

✓ **Evaluate with Benchmarks** Intelligently match your simulation requirements with the most suitable computational resources using our benchmarking feature.
