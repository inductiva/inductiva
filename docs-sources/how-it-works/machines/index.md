# Computational Resources

The Inductiva API transforms complex computational resource management into a seamless experience, providing you with direct access to powerful computing infrastructure through simple Python commands. Whether you need to run a single simulation or orchestrate thousands of parallel tasks, our unified interface abstracts away the complexity of resource provisioning, allocation, and management.

## How It Works

At its core, the Inductiva API acts as an intelligent intermediary between your simulation needs and diverse computational resources. When you submit a simulation task, the API automatically handles the entire lifecycle: from selecting the optimal computational resource based on your requirements, to provisioning the necessary infrastructure, orchestrating the simulation execution, and delivering results back to you.

This approach eliminates the traditional barriers of computational resource managementâ€”no need to worry about server configuration, scaling decisions, or infrastructure maintenance. You simply define what you want to compute, and the API takes care of the rest.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll discover:

- **Resource Allocation Strategies**: Learn how to choose between shared and dedicated resources, and understand when each option provides the best value for your specific use case
- **Infrastructure Landscape**: Explore the diverse computational options available through the API, from cloud providers to specialized HPC solutions, and understand how the API unifies access to these varied resources
- **Practical Implementation**: See real-world examples of how to configure and deploy different resource types for optimal performance and cost-effectiveness

Whether you're running lightweight parameter studies or computationally intensive simulations, this guide will help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and maximize the efficiency of your computational workflows.
