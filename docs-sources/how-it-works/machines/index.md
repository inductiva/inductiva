# Computational Resources
The Inductiva API provides on-demand access to computational infrastructure for running your simulations at any scale. Resources are automatically provisioned and managed, so you can focus on your simulations rather than infrastructure management.

## Get started
Learn about _Resources_ — the core entity in the Inductiva API that executes your simulations. Resources can be cloud machines, your personal computer, or dedicated hardware, all managed through our API that handles its allocation, scaling, and monitoring automatically.

| **[Resources →](shared-dedicated-resources.md)** | **[Manage Resources →](manage-computational-resources.md)** | **[Computational Infrastructure →](computational-infrastructure.md)** |
|---|---|---|
| Learn how to choose beteween the resources made available by our API, and understand when each option provides the best value for your specific use case | Monitor and control your resources with real-time status tracking, cost analysis, and lifecycle management through our Python API, CLI, or Web Console | Understand the diverse computational options available, from cloud machines to your own laptop, and how our API simplifies their access and orchestration |

## Why it's Useful
✓ **Launch resources instantly** Automatically allocate and configure compute infrastructure. No need to manually set up instances or manage infrastructure.

✓ **Scale dynamically** Scale your computational resources up or down based on your simulation demands. Handle everything from single simulations to thousands of parallel tasks.

✓ **Run anywhere** Execute simulations on cloud infrastructure, dedicated servers, or your own hardware. Switch between different environments without changing your code.

✓ **Handle machine preemptions** Automatically detect and recover from machine preemptions. When using cost-effective [Spot Machines](spot-machines.md), interrupted simulations are automatically restarted on new machines without manual intervention.

✓ **Control costs** Get transparent pricing of resource usage and costs.

✓ **Evaluate with Benchmarks** Intelligently match your simulation requirements with the most suitable computational resources using our [benchmarking](https://inductiva.ai/guides/scale-up/benchmark/index) tool.
