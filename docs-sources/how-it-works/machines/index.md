# Computational Resources
The Inductiva API simplifies access to high-performance computing resources through straightforward Python commands. Rather than managing complex infrastructure setup and resource allocation, you can execute single simulations or orchestrate thousands of parallel tasks through our API.

## What You'll Learn
In this section, you'll discover:

- **Resource Selection**: Learn how to choose beteween the dedicated resources made available by our API, and understand when each option provides the best value for your specific use case
- **Computational Infrastructure Overview**: Explore the diverse computational options available through the API, from cloud providers to your own laptop, and understand how the API unifies access to these varied resources

Whether you're running lightweight parameter studies or computationally intensive simulations, this guide will help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and maximize the efficiency of your computational workflows.
