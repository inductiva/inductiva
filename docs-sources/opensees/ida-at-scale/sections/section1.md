# Kickstart Your Simulation Workflow

## Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, either as a hands-on walkthrough or as a reference for your own implementation, please 
begin by downloading the simulation files [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/inductiva-api-demo-files/opensees-tutorials/IDA-at-scale.zip).

The files are organized into three folders:
- `inputFiles_template` – contains the FEM model definition and analysis scripts, including the dynamic analysis template (`.jinja` file) that will be modified within the script’s loops
- `outputFiles` – the directory where the analysis results will be saved
- `Records` – contains the 30 acceleration time-histories required for the IDAs

Additionally, the record duration file `records_duration.txt` will be read during the execution of the simulation script.

The full simulation script (`simulation-script.py`) is included to ensure reproducibility and easy adaptation for your own workflows.

## Simulation Overview
For a primer on running a single OpenSees simulation, check out our introductory tutorial [here](quick-start).

In this tutorial, we take a significant step forward: executing **300 IDA simulations in a single run**, leveraging a high-throughput workflow using the [EESD OpenSees distribution](https://github.com/eesd-epfl/OpenSees).

### Why 300 Simulations?
These simulations are generated by combining:
- **30 real-world ground motion records**, and
- **10 intensity levels** per record

Rather than manually defining each simulation, we use Inductiva’s **Templating Manager**. Starting from a single base configuration, it automatically generates multiple simulation cases by replacing predefined input values with parameterized variables. This approach enables easy exploration of a wide scenario space — with minimal manual setup.

Don’t worry if that sounds complex, we will guide you through each step.
