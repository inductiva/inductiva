## About OpenSees
[OpenSees](https://opensees.berkeley.edu) (Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) is a software framework designed for the development of sequential, 
parallel and grid-enabled finite element applications in earthquake engineering. It allows users to simulate the response of structural and 
geotechnical systems subjected to earthquakes and other hazards using scripts written in either Tcl or Python.
