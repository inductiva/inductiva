Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to accelerate your GX simulations using top-tier Cloud GPUs, including **NVIDIA A100** and **H100**, or run hundreds of simulations in parallel for your design optimization projects using cost-effective Cloud GPUs such as **NVIDIA L4**.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check!

## About GX
[GX](https://gx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a GPU-native model for solving the nonlinear gyrokinetic system for low-frequency turbulence in magnetized plasmas, in particular tokamaks and stellarators, using Fourier-Hermite-Laguerre spectral methods. This software has proven ideal for fusion reactor design and optimization, as well as for general physics research.
