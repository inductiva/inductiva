## About GX
[GX](https://gx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a GPU-native model for solving the nonlinear gyrokinetic system for low-frequency turbulence in magnetized plasmas, in particular tokamaks and stellarators, using Fourier-Hermite-Laguerre spectral methods. This software has proven ideal for fusion reactor design and optimization, as well as for general physics research.

## Container Images
Each version of GX in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=gx), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/gx).
