## About NWChem
[NWChem](https://www.nwchem-sw.org) is optimised for large-scale simulations on modern HPC systems, enabling the study of complex chemical phenomena. Its modular architecture allows for continuous improvement, making it a trusted tool for high-accuracy computational chemistry in both isolated molecules and extended materials. It includes a range of quantum mechanical methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), Hartree-Fock and post-Hartree-Fock approaches.

## Container Images
Each version of NWChem in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=nwchem), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/nwchem).
