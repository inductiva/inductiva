## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This benchmark evaluates the performance of the **NWChem** simulator by running the **Hybrid density functional calculation on the C240 Buckyball** simulation.  
This NWChem simulation benchmarks the Gaussian basis set DFT module by running a
PBE0 calculation in direct mode on the C240 system using the 6-31G\* basis set
(3600 functions) without symmetry.

## Computational Resources Tested

The benchmark was conducted on the following machine families:

### Intel-based
- **C2**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Cascade Lake)

- **C3**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Sapphire Rapids)

- **C4**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Granite Rapids) â€” latest generation

### AMD-based
- **C2D**  
  AMD EPYC (Rome)

- **C3D**  
  AMD EPYC (Genoa)

- **C4D**  
  AMD EPYC (Turin) â€” latest generation

### Notes on Machine Selection
- Some configurations were excluded due to **insufficient memory**:  
  - `c3d-highcpu-16`  
  - `c2d-highcpu-16`  
  - local test machines
  - Other setups with low memory
- For the **C2 family**, only the `standard` configuration was tested, as `highcpu` variants are not available.
