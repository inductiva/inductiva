Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check!

## About WRF

The [**Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model**](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf)
is a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction system designed for both
atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. Developed collaboratively
by the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), the
[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/), and
several other agencies and research institutions, WRF provides a flexible and
scalable platform for simulating a wide range of meteorological phenomena, from
large-scale global patterns to small-scale localized events such as thunderstorms
and hurricanes. The model supports high-resolution simulations and is capable of
capturing complex interactions between the atmosphere and other Earth system
components, including the land surface and oceans.


## What You'll Find Here
