## About WRF
The [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) is a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction system developed to meet both atmospheric research and operational forecasting demands. It offers a flexible, scalable platform capable of simulating a broad spectrum of meteorological phenomena — from large-scale global patterns to localized events like thunderstorms and hurricanes. 

WRF supports high-resolution simulations and effectively captures the complex interactions between the atmosphere and other Earth system components, including land surfaces and oceans.
