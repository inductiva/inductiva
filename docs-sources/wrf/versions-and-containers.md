## About WRF
The [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) is a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction system developed to meet both atmospheric research and operational forecasting demands. It offers a flexible, scalable platform capable of simulating a broad spectrum of meteorological phenomena ‚Äî from large-scale global patterns to localized events like thunderstorms and hurricanes. 

WRF supports high-resolution simulations and effectively captures the complex interactions between the atmosphere and other Earth system components, including land surfaces and oceans.

## Container Images
Each version of WRF in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=wrf), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/wrf).
