## About HEC-RAS
[HEC-RAS](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/), developed by the Hydrologic
Engineering Center (CEIWR-HEC), is a powerful river analysis system designed for
simulating and analyzing hydraulic conditions in natural and engineered waterways.
The software provides a wide range of capabilities, including one-dimensional
steady flow simulations, one- and two-dimensional unsteady flow calculations,
sediment transport and mobile bed modeling, as well as water temperature and
water quality analysis. These features make HEC-RAS a comprehensive tool for
engineers and researchers working on river hydraulics, floodplain management,
sediment dynamics, and environmental studies, supporting both practical
decision-making and scientific research.

## Container Images
Each version of HEC-RAS in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=hec-ras), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/hec-ras).
