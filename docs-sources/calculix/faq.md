# FAQ

## 1. Why can't I use CalculiX GraphiX (`cgx`)?
The `cgx` command is not included in the CalculiX container images provided by Inductiva, as it is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool. Our containers are designed for command-line operations only.

For pre- and post-processing, we recommend using `cgx` on your local machine. Once your setup is complete, you can run the simulation in the cloud using the Inductiva API.
