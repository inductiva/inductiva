# FAQ

## 1. I can't use CalculiX GraphiX `cgx`. Why?

The `cgx` command is not available in the CalculiX container images provided by
Inductiva. This is because `cgx` is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool, and
our container images are designed for command-line operations only.

Our recommendation is to run any pre-processing or post-processing on your local
machine using `cgx`, and then use the Inductiva API to run the actual
simulation on the cloud.
