## About CalculiX
[CalculiX](https://www.calculix.de/) is an open-source Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) software package designed for solving structural, thermal, and coupled
mechanical problems. Inspired by commercial codes like Abaqus, CalculiX supports
linear and nonlinear static analysis, dynamic analysis, contact problems, and
heat transfer simulations. It uses an input file format similar to Abaqus,
making it familiar to many engineers, and can handle both small-scale academic
problems and large-scale industrial models.

## Container Images
Each version of CalculiX in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=calculix), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/calculix).
