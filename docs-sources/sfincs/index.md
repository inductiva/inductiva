# The Inductiva Guide to SFINCS
Your resource hub for all things SFINCS at Inductiva. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to seamlessly run your SFINCS simulations on Cloud machines equipped with hundreds of cores and terabytes of disk space.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

## About SFINCS
The [SFINCS](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/sfincs) (Super-Fast INundation of CoastS) model is a reduced-complexity simulation 
engine developed by [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en). It is designed 
to simulate compound coastal flooding with high computational efficiency 
while maintaining reliable accuracy.

Featuring a grid-based structure that handles complex topographies, SFINCS is particularly well-suited for large-scale, high-resolution inundation modeling
where computational speed is crucial.
