Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

## About SFINCS
[SFINCS](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/sfincs) is a
hydrodynamic model designed for rapid and efficient simulation of coastal and
fluvial flooding. Unlike traditional full-physics models, SFINCS uses a
simplified physics approach based on the shallow water equations with various
approximations, enabling it to compute flood extents and water levels at high
speeds while maintaining sufficient accuracy for decision-making and emergency
response. Its grid-based structure supports complex topographies, and it is
particularly well-suited for large-scale, high-resolution inundation modeling
where computational speed is crucial.
