# The Inductiva Guide to SFINCS

Your resource hub for all things SFINCS at Inductiva. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to seamlessly run your SFINCS simulations on Cloud machines equipped with hundreds of cores and terabytes of disk space.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

Featuring a grid-based structure that handles complex topographies, SFINCS is particularly well-suited for large-scale, high-resolution inundation modeling
where computational speed is crucial.
