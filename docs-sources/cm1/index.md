## About CM1
[CM1 (Cloud Model 1)](https://asap.ucar.edu/software/cm1/) is a three-dimensional, time-dependent, non-hydrostatic numerical model designed for idealized studies of mesoscale atmospheric phenomena. Researchers use it in particular to study deep convective precipitation (thunderstorms).

## What You'll Find Here
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides to help you learn how to run CM1 through the Inductiva API. From getting started to advanced tutorials, we have you covered.
- **Benchmarks:** A trusted guide to selecting the right simulation hardware for your needs. These benchmarks, conducted using the Inductiva platform, provide insight into how CM1 performs on different hardware configurations.
