## About CM1
[CM1 (Cloud Model 1)](https://asap.ucar.edu/software/cm1/) is a
high-resolution, atmospheric simulation model primarily used for studying cloud
dynamics, convection, and atmospheric processes. It is designed to simulate
cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection at various scales, from small
convective cells to large storm systems. CM1 is highly configurable, allowing
researchers to explore a wide range of atmospheric phenomena and improve weather
forecasting models. Its flexibility makes it a valuable tool for investigating
processes such as cloud formation, precipitation, and the interactions between
cloud systems and large-scale weather patterns.
