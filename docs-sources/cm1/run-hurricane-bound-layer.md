# LES of Hurricane Bound Layer ðŸŒª

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to simulate a simplified hurricane boundary
layer (HBL) using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) on the Inductiva platform. This
setup follows the methodology of Bryan et al. (2017) **[1]**.

The hurricane boundary layer is the lowest portion of the atmosphere in a
tropical cyclone where turbulence, surface friction, and radial inflow are
dominant. This LES setup simulates the internal dynamics of the HBL without full
coupling to large-scale weather systems.

We will also demonstrate Inductivaâ€™s ability to efficiently scale this use case,
starting with a cloud machine equivalent to a typical laptop and then scaling up
to more powerful machines.

## Prerequisites

The required files may be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/inductiva-api-demo-files/cm1-les-hurr-bound-layer.zip).
Note that manual download is not necessary since the run script will donwload
it.

## Key Considerations

TODO

## Run the Simulation

Below is the code required to run the hurricane boundary layer use case with
the Inductiva API.

The simulation will then be sent to a `c2d-higcpu-16` virtual machine from
Google Cloud, equipped with 16 vCPU and 32 GB of RAM. This machine is
equivalent to a standard working laptop.

```python
"""LES of Hurricane Bound Layer."""
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup(
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-16",
    spot=True,
)

# Set simulation input directory
input_dir = inductiva.utils.download_from_url(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/inductiva-api-demo-files/"
    "cm1-les-hurr-bound-layer.zip",
    unzip=True,
)

# Initialize the Simulator
cm1 = inductiva.simulators.CM1(version="21.1")

# Run simulation with config files in the input directory
task = cm1.run(
    input_dir=input_dir,
    sim_config_filename="namelist.input",
    on=cloud_machine,
)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

Copy and paste it into a file named `run.py` in your working directory and
execute it by running:

````
python run.py
````

The script will take about **1 hour and 36 minutes** to run. In the end, you
should see something like:

```
