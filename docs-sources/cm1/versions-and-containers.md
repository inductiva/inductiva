## About CM1
[CM1 (Cloud Model 1)](https://asap.ucar.edu/software/cm1/) is a three-dimensional, time-dependent, non-hydrostatic numerical model designed for idealized studies of mesoscale atmospheric phenomena. Researchers use it in particular to study deep convective precipitation (thunderstorms).
