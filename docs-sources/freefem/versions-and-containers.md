## About FreeFEM
[FreeFEM](https://freefem.org/) is an open-source partial differential equation
(PDE) solver widely used in scientific computing and engineering. It provides a
high-level, flexible scripting language that allows users to define problems
quickly using the finite element method (FEM). With FreeFEM, researchers and
engineers can model and simulate a wide variety of physical phenomena such as
fluid dynamics, heat transfer, elasticity, and electromagnetics. Its strength
lies in its ease of use, support for advanced numerical methods, and ability to
handle complex geometries and boundary conditions.

## Supported Versions
Inductiva stays up to date with the latest versions of FreeFEM. Below is a list of the supported versions, along with their respective release dates:

## Container Images
Each version of FreeFEM in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=freefem), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/freefem).
