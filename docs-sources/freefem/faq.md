# FAQ

1. What FreeFEM commands are available for me to use at Inductiva?

You can expect the same binaries as if you had compiled or installed FreeFEM locally.  
Here is the list of FreeFEM commands you can call:

| FreeFem++   | FreeFem++-mpi | FreeFem++-nw | bamg          |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| cvmsh2      | ff-c++        | ff-get-dep   | ff-mpirun     |
| ff-pkg-download | ffglut    | ffmaster     | ffmedit       |
| md2edp      |               |              |               |

> **Note**: Your simulations will run on a virtual machine without display or user input capabilities.  
> Avoid calling functions that rely on a graphical interface (e.g., `plot`), as this will result in errors.
