# Run Your First Simulation
This tutorial will show you how to run Deft3D simulations using the Inductiva API. 

We will cover the `01_standard` use case from the examples available in the [Delft3D Subversion repository](https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/delft3d/branches/releases/7545/),

## Prerequisites
Download the required files [here](https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/delft3d/branches/releases/7545/examples/01_standard/) and save them to a folder named `SimulationFiles`. Then, you’ll be ready to
send your simulation to the Cloud.

## Running a Delft3D Simulation
Here is the code required to run the Delft3D simulation using the Inductiva API:

```python
"""Delft3D Simulation."""
import inductiva

# Allocate a machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2-standard-4",
	spot=True)

# Initialize the Simulator
delft3d = inductiva.simulators.Delft3D(\
    version="6.04.00")

# Run simulation
task = delft3d.run( \
    input_dir="/Path/to/SimulationFiles",
    commands = ["mpirun -np 4 d_hydro.exe config_d_hydro.xml"],
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

In this basic example, we're using a cloud machine (`c2-standard-4`) equipped with 4 virtual CPUs. 
For larger or more compute-intensive simulations, consider adjusting the `machine_type` parameter to select 
a machine with more virtual CPUs and increased memory capacity. You can explore the full range of available machines [here](https://console.inductiva.ai/machine-groups/instance-types).

> **Note**: Setting `spot=True` enables the use of spot machines, which are available at substantial discounts. 
> However, your simulation may be interrupted if the cloud provider reclaims the machine.

To adapt this script for other Delft3D simulations, replace `input_dir` with the
path to your Delft3D input files and set the the `commands` accordingly.

When the simulation is complete, we terminate the machine, download the results and print a summary of the simulation as shown below.

```

As you can see in the "In Progress" line, the part of the timeline that represents the actual execution of the simulation, 
the core computation time of this simulation was approximately 5.2 seconds.
