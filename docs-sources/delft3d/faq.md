## How do I run a Delft3D simulation with FLOW-WAVE coupling?
Running a Delft3D simulation with FLOW-WAVE coupling on Inductiva is just as straightforward as running a standalone FLOW simulation. The key difference is that you need to run two components concurrently:

Running a Delft3D coupled with flow-wave on Inductiva is as easy as running a simple Delft3D simulation, but involves running two components concurrently:
- `d_hydro.exe` for the FLOW (hydrodynamics) module
- `wave.exe` for the WAVE (SWAN) module

For a detailed walkthrough of the setup and execution process, refer to the full this [tutorial](https://inductiva.ai/guides/delft3d/flow-wave-coupling).
