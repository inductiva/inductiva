## About SCHISM
[SCHISM](https://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/) (Semi-Implicit Cross-Scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) is a 3D baroclinic circulation model designed to simulate hydrodynamics at a wide range of scales - from streams, lakes and rivers to estuaries, shelf seas and the open ocean. It is a powerful tool for coastal, estuarine and oceanographic research, allowing detailed study of complex fluid dynamics such as tidal currents, waves and sediment transport.

## Container Images
Each version of SCHISM in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=schism), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/schism).
