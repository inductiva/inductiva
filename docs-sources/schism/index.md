<h3>About SCHISM</h3>

[SCHISM](https://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/) (Semi-Implicit Cross-Scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) is a 3D baroclinic circulation model designed to simulate hydrodynamics at a wide range of scales - from streams, lakes and rivers to estuaries, shelf seas and the open ocean. It is a powerful tool for coastal, estuarine and oceanographic research, allowing detailed study of complex fluid dynamics such as tidal currents, waves and sediment transport.
