## About SCHISM
[SCHISM](https://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/) (Semi-Implicit Cross-Scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) is a 3D baroclinic circulation model designed to simulate hydrodynamics at a wide range of scales - from streams, lakes and rivers to estuaries, shelf seas and the open ocean. It is a powerful tool for coastal, estuarine and oceanographic research, allowing detailed study of complex fluid dynamics such as tidal currents, waves and sediment transport.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides to help you learn how to run SCHISM through the Inductiva API. From getting started to advanced tutorials, we have you covered.
- **Benchmarks:** A trusted guide to selecting the right simulation hardware for your needs. These benchmarks, conducted using the Inductiva platform, provide insight into how SCHISM performs on different hardware configurations.
