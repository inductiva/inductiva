## About SWASH
[SWASH](https://swash.sourceforge.io) (Simulating WAves till SHore) is a numerical tool that simulates unsteady, non-hydrostatic, free-surface, rotational flow and transport phenomena in coastal waters. 
Itâ€™s mainly used to predict wave transformation, ocean circulation, tides and storm surges.
