# Benchmark

## Three-Dimensional Currents
This benchmark focuses on the _S1 simulation_ as outlined in the paper "[Modeled Three-Dimensional Currents and Eddies on an Alongshore-Variable Barred Beach]"(https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JC016899), authored by _Christine M. Baker, Melissa Moulton, Britt Raubenheimer, Steve Elgar, and Nirnimesh Kumar_ (2021). To better suit the purposes of this benchmark, we limited the simulation duration to 10 and 100 seconds to ensure that each simulation completes within approximately 5 and 28 minutes, respectively, when running on the slowest machines.
