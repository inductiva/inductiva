## About WAVEWATCH III
[WAVEWATCH III](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/wavewatch/) is a numerical wave model developed by NOAA/NCEP that 
simulates the behavior of ocean surface waves. It solves the spectral action density balance equation for wave 
modeling and includes features for shallow water and surf zones, enabling application in diverse marine environments.
