Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

<h3>About FVCOM</h3>

[FVCOM](https://github.com/FVCOM-GitHub/FVCOM) (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) is a 3D hydrodynamic model specifically designed for simulating coastal and ocean dynamics. It uses an unstructured grid and finite-volume methods, making it highly adaptable for modeling complex coastlines, estuaries, and bathymetry. Itâ€™s a valuable tool for studying marine ecosystems, coastal environments, and the impacts of climate change on ocean systems.

## Supported Versions
Inductiva currently supports the following versions of FVCOM:
- **v5.1.0** (Feb., 2023) 

Inductiva has compiled two FVCOM builds:
- **fvcom**: The standard version for general use
- **fvcom_estuary**: Configured to run the Estuary test case included with FVCOM
