## About FVCOM
[FVCOM](https://github.com/FVCOM-GitHub/FVCOM) (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) is a 3D hydrodynamic model specifically designed for simulating coastal and ocean dynamics. It uses an unstructured grid and finite-volume methods, making it highly adaptable for modeling complex coastlines, estuaries, and bathymetry. Itâ€™s a valuable tool for studying marine ecosystems, coastal environments, and the impacts of climate change on ocean systems.
