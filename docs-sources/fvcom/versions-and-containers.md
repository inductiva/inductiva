## About FVCOM
[FVCOM](https://github.com/FVCOM-GitHub/FVCOM) (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) is a 3D hydrodynamic model specifically designed for simulating coastal and ocean dynamics. It uses an unstructured grid and finite-volume methods, making it highly adaptable for modeling complex coastlines, estuaries, and bathymetry. It‚Äôs a valuable tool for studying marine ecosystems, coastal environments, and the impacts of climate change on ocean systems.

## Container Images
Each version of FVCOM in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=fvcom), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/fvcom).
