# Run Your First Simulation
This tutorial will show you how to run Quantum ESPRESSO simulations using the Inductiva API. 

To help you get started with simulations, we will explore a use case from this [Atomsk tutorial](https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr/tutorial_QE.php), which guides us in creating a unit cell for fcc aluminium.

## Prerequisites
Copy and create your `Al.pw` file, placing it in a designated folder. Then, make the following adjustments:
- Remove the line of code that specifies the `pseudo` directory path: `pseudo_dir = '/home/user/espresso/pseudo/'`.
- Under the section labeled *ATOMIC_SPECIES*, update the pseudopotential file: Change `Al 26.982 Al.fixme.upf` to `Al 26.982 Al.pbe-nl-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF`.

You're ready to send your simulation to the Cloud!

## Running a Quantum ESPRESSO Simulation
Here is the code required to run a Quantum ESPRESSO simulation using the Inductiva API:

```python
"""Quantum ESPRESSO example."""
import inductiva
from inductiva.commands import MPIConfig, Command

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-4",
    spot=True)

mpi_config = MPIConfig( \
    version="4.1.6",
    np=4,
    use_hwthread_cpus=True)

# List of commands to run
commands = [
    Command("pw.x -i Al.pw", mpi_config=mpi_config),
]

# Initialize the Simulator
qe = inductiva.simulators.QuantumEspresso(\
    version="7.4.1")

# Run simulation
task = qe.run( \
    input_dir="/Path/to/SimulationFiles",
    commands=commands,
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

In this basic example, we're using a cloud machine (`c2d-highcpu-4`) equipped with 4 virtual CPUs. 
For larger or more compute-intensive simulations, consider adjusting the `machine_type` parameter to select 
a machine with more virtual CPUs and increased memory capacity. You can explore the full range of available machines [here](https://console.inductiva.ai/machine-groups/instance-types).

> **Note**: Setting `spot=True` enables the use of [spot machines](../how-it-works/machines/spot-machines.md), which are available at substantial discounts. 
> However, your simulation may be interrupted if the cloud provider reclaims the machine.

To adapt this script for other Quantum ESPRESSO simulations, replace `input_dir` with the
path to your Quantum ESPRESSO input files.

When the simulation is complete, we terminate the machine, download the results and print a summary of the simulation as shown below.

As you can see in the "In Progress" line, the part of the timeline that represents the actual execution of the simulation, 
the core computation time of this simulation was approximately 3.2 seconds.
