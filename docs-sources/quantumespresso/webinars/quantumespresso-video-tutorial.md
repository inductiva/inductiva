# Quantum ESPRESSO on Inductiva
In **Episode 4** of our webinar series *Run It with Inductiva.AI*, we demonstrate how 
**Inductiva** simplifies running complex **DFT workflows** at massive scale using **Quantum ESPRESSO**.

Whether you’re calculating band structures, total energies, phonons, or simulating materials under strain, the Inductiva platform helps you move from setup to results faster, with high-performance infrastructure built for large-scale quantum simulations.

💡 **What you’ll learn**:
- Why integrate Quantum ESPRESSO with Inductiva? (*Scalability, ease of use, and efficiency*)
- Live demo: Running Quantum ESPRESSO on the Inductiva platform
- Tips, performance metrics, and real-world applications
- Q&A and next steps to get started
