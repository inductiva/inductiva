# Quantum ESPRESSO on Inductiva
In **Episode 4** of our webinar series *Run It with Inductiva.AI*, we demonstrate how 
**Inductiva** simplifies running complex **DFT workflows** at massive scale using **Quantum ESPRESSO**.

Whether youâ€™re calculating band structures, total energies, phonons, or simulating materials under strain, the Inductiva platform helps you move from setup to results faster, with high-performance infrastructure built for large-scale quantum simulations.

ðŸ’¡ **What youâ€™ll learn**:
- How to run Quantum ESPRESSO simulations on Inductiva.AI
- Live demo on the platform
- Q&A / Next Steps
