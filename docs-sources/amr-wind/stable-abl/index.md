## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This benchmark evaluates the performance of the **AMR-Wind** simulator by running a **stable atmospheric boundary layer** simulation.  
The simulation uses an uniform mesh resolution and directly follows well-established reference studies in the literature.

## Computational Resources Tested

The benchmark was conducted on the following machine series:

### Intel-based
- **C2**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Cascade Lake)

- **C3**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Sapphire Rapids)

- **C4**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Granite Rapids) â€” latest generation

### AMD-based
- **C2D**  
  AMD EPYC (Rome)

- **C3D**  
  AMD EPYC (Genoa)

- **C4D**  
  AMD EPYC (Turin) â€” latest generation

### Notes on Machine Selection

- This simulation requires approximately **150 GB of memory** (with actual usage varying depending on the number of cores).  
  As a result, some machine configurations were excluded due to **insufficient resources**, including:
  - `c3d-highcpu-60`  
  - `c4d-highcpu-64`  
  - Local test machines  
  - Other similar or lower end setups

- Within the **C2 series**, only the `standard` configuration was evaluated, since `highcpu` variants are not available.
