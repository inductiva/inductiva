# Evaluating AMR-Wind Performance on Multi-Machine Clusters
This page presents detailed performance benchmark of AMR-Wind simulations conducted on various multi-node MPI cluster configurations. Runtimes and speedups are compared against a baseline single-node setup.

For this purpose, we used the *neutral Atmospheric Boundary Layer case* from the [AMR-Wind GitHub repository](https://github.com/Exawind/exawind-benchmarks/tree/main/amr-wind/atmospheric_boundary_layer/neutral/input_files).

## Results
Below are the results of running this simulation on a multi-node MPI cluster, compared to the single-node configuration (shown in the first row):

Runtime consistently decreased as the cluster size grew. The best performance was recorded with **8 machines** (896 vCPUs), completing the simulation in **42 minutes and 48 seconds** ‚Äî a major improvement over the single-machine runtime of **144 minutes**. 

Runtime consistently decreased as the cluster size increased. With **8 machines** (896 vCPUs), the simulation completed in 30 minutes and 48 seconds, achieving a speedup of 4.68 times compared to the single-machine runtime of 144 minutes.
