# Evaluating AMR-Wind Performance on Multi-Machine Clusters
This page presents detailed performance benchmark of AMR-Wind simulations conducted on various multi-node MPI cluster configurations. Runtimes and speedups are compared against a baseline single-node setup.

For this purpose, we used the *neutral Atmospheric Boundary Layer case* from the [AMR-Wind GitHub repository](https://github.com/Exawind/exawind-benchmarks/tree/main/amr-wind/atmospheric_boundary_layer/neutral/input_files).

## Results
Below are the results of running this simulation on a multi-node MPI cluster, compared to the single-node configuration (shown in the first row):

Runtime decreased as the cluster size increased. With **16 machines** (896 vCPUs), the simulation completed 
in **30 minutes and 48 seconds**, achieving a **speedup of 4.68x** compared to the single-machine runtime of 144 minutes.

Although adding more machines yields noticeable speedups, for a problem of this size, the benefits quickly taper off due to diminishing returns as the cluster size increases.
