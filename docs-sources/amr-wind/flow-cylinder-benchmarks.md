# Performance Comparison: CPU vs. GPU Configurations
This benchmark report presents a performance and cost comparison across various CPU and GPU configurations. We identify the most effective hardware setup for running a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workload, balancing speed, cost-efficiency, and resource utilization.

We benchmark the *flow around a circular cylinder case* from the [AMR-Wind GitHub repository](https://github.com/Exawind/amr-wind/tree/main/test/test_files/ib_cylinder_Re_300), simulating flow over a cylinder at a Reynolds number of 10,000 using a 20-million-cell mesh.

## How to Choose the Best Machine for Your CFD Workload
The ideal compute instance for you depends on your priorities. 

**If Speed Is Your Top Priority**: Opt for the fastest GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 or A100 instances to minimize simulation runtime. While these come at a higher hourly cost, the overall faster completion can reduce total expense.

**If Cost Efficiency Is Most Important**: High-core-count CPUs such as the **AMD c2d-highcpu-112** provide solid performance for the lowest cost. Consider entry-level GPUs like the **NVIDIA L4** for some acceleration without significant cost increases.

**If You Are Exploring or Just Getting Started**: Begin with modest configurations to profile your workload and use our benchmarks as a reference to make informed scaling decisions or decide whether GPU acceleration is worthwhile.

Whatever your priorities, Inductiva takes care of the infrastructure, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your CFD projects.
