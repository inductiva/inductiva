Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

## About FDS
[FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) (Fire Dynamics Simulator) is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model designed to simulate fire-driven fluid flows. FDS numerically solves the Navier-Stokes equations to model low-speed, thermally-driven flows with a focus on smoke and heat transport from fires. It is commonly used in simulations for designing smoke management systems, evaluating sprinkler and detector activation, and fire reconstructions.
