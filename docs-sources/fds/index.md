Your resource hub for all things FDS at Inductiva. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to seamlessly run your FDS simulations on Cloud machines equipped with hundreds of cores and terabytes of disk space.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

## About FDS
[FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) (Fire Dynamics Simulator) is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model designed to simulate fire-driven fluid flows. FDS numerically solves the Navier-Stokes equations to model low-speed, thermally-driven flows with a focus on smoke and heat transport from fires. It is commonly used in simulations for designing smoke management systems, evaluating sprinkler and detector activation, and fire reconstructions.
