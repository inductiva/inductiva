# Visualizing Results with Smokeview

Smokeview is a program used to visualize results of FDS simulations.
In this tutorial, we'll show you how you can run it directly on Inductiva after running your simulations,
using the "Town House Kitchen Fire" example from the [Smokeview repository](https://github.com/firemodels/smv/tree/master/Verification/Visualization).

## Prerequisites


Before running the simulation, you should have been able to [run your first FDS simulation](setup-test.md).
Youâ€™ll also need to download the required input files. For this tutorial we'll the `thouse5.fds` and `thouse5_movies.ssf`
files, with some small modifications. For your convenience, you can download them from [here]() ready to use.
