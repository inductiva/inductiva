## About Octopus
[Octopus](https://octopus-code.org/documentation/13/manual/about_octopus/) is a software package for performing 
density-functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations. It focuses on 
real-space methods to model electron-ion dynamics in systems under time-dependent electromagnetic fields. This simulator 
is known for its simplicity, allowing intuitive visualizations of wave functions and electron densities. It has 
been successfully used to calculate spectra, laser-induced processes, and more across various systems.

## Supported Versioms
Inductiva stays up to date with the latest versions of Octopus.
Below is a list of the supported versions, along with their respective release dates:

We’ll be happy to accommodate your request!

## Container Images
Each version of Octopus in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=octopus), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/octopus).
