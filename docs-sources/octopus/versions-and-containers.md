## About Octopus
[Octopus](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation/16/) is scientific program designed to simulate the 
quantum-mechanical behavior of electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids using Time-Dependent Density Functional 
Theory (TDDFT). Its real-space grid representation allows for flexible boundary conditions and supports a wide range of 
calculations, including ground-state properties, excited states, molecular dynamics, and electron dynamics in external fields.

## Container Images
Each version of Octopus in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=octopus), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/octopus).
