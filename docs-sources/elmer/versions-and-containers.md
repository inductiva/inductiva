## About Elmer
[Elmer](https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/) is an open-source finite element
software for multiphysical simulations. It allows users to solve complex
engineering and scientific problems involving fluid dynamics, structural
mechanics, heat transfer, electromagnetics, and more. Elmer provides a flexible
framework with a modular architecture, supporting both pre-defined solvers and
custom user-defined equations. It is widely used in academia and industry for
its versatility, accuracy, and ability to handle coupled multiphysics problems
efficiently.

## Container Images
Each version of Elmer in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=elmer), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/elmer).
