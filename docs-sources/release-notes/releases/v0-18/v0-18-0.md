## 🚀 Improvements

### 📈 Real-time System Metrics
In our [last release](https://inductiva.ai/blog/article/hpc-simulation-tools-v017), we introduced system metrics tracking (like CPU and RAM usage) to help you make sure you’re using resources efficiently. For instance, you could check that all vCPUs were being used in parallel to make the most of a powerful cloud machine.

However, there was a catch: these metrics were only available after a simulation finished. This made it hard to understand in real-time if a task was running efficiently and kill it early to avoid wasting credits.

Now, that’s no longer the case. [Task System Metrics](https://console.inductiva.ai/tasks) are updated automatically with fresh data at sub-minute intervals, giving you live performance insights so you can monitor efficiency and make smarter decisions as your simulations run.

### 🐍 Python Editor
Formerly known as the Playground, the online [Python Editor](https://console.inductiva.ai/editor) has been upgraded to include ready-to-run code snippets for every simulator supported by Inductiva. Simply choose your preferred simulator from the dropdown menu, and the corresponding example code will appear automatically. From the Console, just click “Run” and your simulation will start instantly.

### 🧩 Tiles View for Projects and Benchmarks

You can now switch to a tile view for your [Projects](https://console.inductiva.ai/projects) and [Benchmarks](https://console.inductiva.ai/benchmarks) to have a cleaner, more visual alternative to the traditional table layout. This update is especially helpful when accessing Inductiva from a mobile device, where the new layout adapts smoothly to smaller screens for a better user experience.

We’re starting with Projects and Benchmarks, but this is just the beginning. The tile view will soon expand to all Console screens, bringing a more consistent and intuitive interface across the platform.

### 🧺 Bulk Task Actions within Projects

Move multiple tasks between Projects at once, making project organization faster and more efficient.

### 📂 Drag-and-Drop Folder Upload

Uploading to your Inductiva cloud storage is now easier than ever. Simply drag and drop entire folders into the new upload interface — the platform will automatically handle all files inside, making data management faster and more intuitive.

![Drag_drop](../../../_static/Drag_drop.png)


### 👤 New Layout for the Account Tab

You may have noticed a small but meaningful change: the Account tab has moved to the upper-left corner of the sidebar for quicker access. It’s a simple adjustment that makes navigation smoother and overall improves the user experience.

You will find there all of the same menu options, plus the new Achievements.

### 🖱️ CTRL-Click to Open in a New Tab

You can now open table rows (in Storage, Task lists, etc.) in a new browser tab by holding CTRL (or Command ⌘ on macOS) while clicking. It’s a small detail, but one that makes navigation faster and more convenient, especially when working across multiple items.

## 🔜 Looking Ahead
- Built-in notification system - Receive critical alerts instantly via Inductiva's Web Console.
- “No files left behind!” – a clever automatic mechanism to save all the output files to permanent storage, even when your spot instance is preempted by the underlying cloud provider.
