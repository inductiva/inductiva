## ‚ú® New Features

### üîî Inductiva Alerts - Web Console Notifications
Inductiva Alerts are predefined by Inductiva to notify users as quickly as possible about events that could disrupt their work. Due to their potential high impact, they are always sent via email, and can now also appear directly in the web Console. 
Conveniently located in the top right corner of the web console, they offer direct links to custom actions.

Users can manage which alerts they want to receive in the Console through the new settings screen. Additionally, you can choose to enable or disable a sound, ensuring you are alerted even when you‚Äôre focusing on other tasks.

### üëÄObserver Events
Observer Events are user-defined alerts that notify you about specific events occurring in your simulations, by monitoring specific file or log events. These are sent by email only, and only if you choose to enable email notifications for them.

This feature enables proactive monitoring of your simulations, whether to confirm success or respond quickly to errors.

**Key capabilities:**
- Detects when files are created or modified (e.g. error logs)
- Supports regular expressions to identify patterns in file content
- Extracts key information from matched expressions
- Compatible with any simulator that writes logs or intermediate files

## üîú Looking Ahead

- This release marks the first step toward giving users full control over how they receive notifications. While you can now view alerts directly in the Console and adjust which appear there, the next iteration will go further ‚Äî allowing you to choose the communication channel (email and/or Console) for each alert type.
- Work continues on the mechanism to save the output after a spot instance is preempted feature we previewed [last release](https://inductiva.ai/blog/article/release-v018). We're making solid progress and expect to share more details very soon.
