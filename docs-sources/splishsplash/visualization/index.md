# Visualizing SPlisHSPlasH Simulations with Python

This tutorial builds upon the [Generate Synthetic Data for Physics-Informed ML](../synthetic-data-for-piml/index.md) guide.
We pick up from the [Generate the Dataset](../synthetic-data-for-piml/sections/section4.md) section.

We'll begin by showing how to convert individual simulation outputs into visually
appealing GIFs. Then, we'll demonstrate how to combine multiple GIFs into a single animation.
