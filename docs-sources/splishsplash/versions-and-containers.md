## About SPlisHSPlasH
[SPlisHSPlasH](https://splishsplash.physics-simulation.org) is an open-source library for the simulation of fluids and solids using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. It efficiently models complex fluid behaviour by considering neighbouring particles. The library includes pressure solvers for the simulation of incompressible fluids and provides different methods for the simulation of viscosity, surface tension, vorticity, elasticity and drag forces.

## Container Images
Each version of SPlisHSPlasH in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=splishsplash), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/splishsplash).
