# Welcome to OpenTelemac at Inductiva ðŸŒŠ
Your resource hub for all things OpenTelemac at Inductiva. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to seamlessly run your OpenTelemac simulations on Cloud machines equipped with hundreds of cores and terabytes of disk space.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check! 

<h3>About OpenTelemac</h3>

[OpenTelemac](https://www.opentelemac.org) is an open-source suite of simulation tools developed for modeling free-surface environmental hydraulics. It is widely used in river engineering, coastal modeling, sediment transport, and water quality studies.

Developed by EDF R&D and a wide network of European partners, OpenTelemac features a modular structure and supports unstructured meshes, high-performance computing (HPC), and robust numerical solvers. Its architecture enables integration of multiple physical processes under a unified computational framework. The suite includes:

- **TELEMAC-2D**: Simulates 2D shallow water flows using the Saint-Venant equations. Ideal for tides, flood modeling, and river hydraulics.
- **TELEMAC-3D**: A 3D non-hydrostatic model solving Navier-Stokes equations with support for turbulence, stratification, and tracer transport.
- **GAIA**: Models sediment transport in 2D and 3D environments, including bedload and suspended sediment processes.
- **TOMAWAC**: Spectral wave model for simulating wave propagation from offshore to coastal zones.
- **ARTEMIS**: Handles wave agitation in harbors and near structures based on mild-slope equations.
- **MASCARET**: One-dimensional hydraulics solver ideal for rivers and canal flows.
- **WAQTEL**: Simulates water quality and thermal processes, optionally coupled with the AED2 model for advanced biochemical simulations.
- **KHIONE**: Focuses on ice formation and interactions between water, air, and ice in cold regions.
