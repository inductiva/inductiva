# Prerequisites
Before running a TurbSim simulation, it's important to ensure that all the necessary files are set up correctly. 

Download the required [`90m_12mps_twr.inp`](https://github.com/OpenFAST/r-test/blob/v4.0.2/glue-codes/openfast/5MW_Baseline/Wind/90m_12mps_twr.inp) file and place it in your working directory under a folder named `input_files`. Your directory structure should look like this:

- `input_files/`  
  └── `90m_12mps_twr.inp`

This `90m_12mps_twr.inp` file is part of the [`5MW_Baseline`](https://github.com/OpenFAST/r-test/tree/v4.0.2/glue-codes/openfast/5MW_Baseline) configuration provided in the OpenFAST repository. The 5MW_Baseline represents a standard 5-megawatt wind turbine model that is often used for testing and validation.

That’s it — you’re ready to send your simulation to the Cloud!
