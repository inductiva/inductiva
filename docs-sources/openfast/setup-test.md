# Test Your Inductiva Setup

Before diving into tutorials and benchmarks, let's ensure that your Inductiva Python package is properly set up. To confirm everything is working as expected, simply run a quick OpenFAST simulation â€” it only takes a few seconds!

## Step 1: Copy and Run the Code
To get started, copy the code below and paste it into a Python script.

When you run the script, all the necessary simulation artifacts and configuration files will be automatically downloaded to your computer. The OpenFAST simulation will then be sent to a cloud machine for execution.

```python
"""OpenFAST example."""
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-2",
    spot=True)

# Download the input files into a folder
input_dir = inductiva.utils.download_from_url(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/inductiva-api-demo-files/"
    "openfastv4.0.2-input-example.zip",
    unzip=True)

# List of commands to run
commands = ["openfast 5MW_OC4Semi_WSt_WavesWN/"
            "5MW_OC4Semi_WSt_WavesWN.fst"]

# Initialize the Simulator
openfast = inductiva.simulators.OpenFAST( \
    version="4.0.2")

# Run simulation
task = openfast.run( \
    input_dir=input_dir,
    commands=commands,
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

## Step 2: Verify the Task Status
After the simulation completes, a task summary will be displayed in your terminal. If the task status shows **Success**, congratulations! You've successfully run an OpenFAST simulation.

You're ready to start running simulations seamlessly!
