# FAQ

## 1. Can OpenFAST be run in parallel?
Yes, OpenFAST can be run in parallel, but only under specific conditions. To
utilize parallel processing, OpenFAST requires either OpenMP support via OLAF
(OpenFAST Large-Area Farm) or the FAST.Farm framework. These tools enable
parallel execution. If you are not using OLAF or FAST.Farm, OpenFAST will run
in a single-threaded mode and cannot take advantage of parallel computing capabilities.

## 2. What is the best machine for running OpenFAST?
The ideal machine for running OpenFAST depends on how you plan to run it. If
you're using OpenFAST with parallel processing (through OLAF or FAST.Farm),
a machine with a higher number of cores will provide better performance. However,
if youâ€™re running OpenFAST in serial mode (without parallel support), a more
affordable machine with fewer cores will suffice, as OpenFAST won't utilize
additional cores in this mode.

## 3. Can I run multiple OpenFAST simulations in parallel?
Absolutely! Running multiple simulations in parallel is the best way to fully
utilize your available cloud resources. While OpenFAST can have limitations in
terms of parallelism for individual simulations, executing several simulations
concurrently allows you to maximize efficiency. For detailed guidance on how to
set this up, check out this [OpenFAST tutorial](https://inductiva.ai/guides/openfast/OpenFAST_advanced)
to see how you can do it.

## 4. How to Load the `libdiscon.so` library?

Some simulations require the `libdiscon.so` library. To simplify the process,
we've included this library in our simulation image. You can use it by
referencing the following path in your simulation files:  

```
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdiscon.so
```
