# Generate visualization for your DualSPHysics simulation

Sometimes, generating a meaningful visualization for a simulation can be just as
important as running the simulation itself. While raw data and numerical outputs
are essential for scientific analysis, they often lack the clarity and impact
needed to fully understand complex physical phenomena. A good visualization can
reveal patterns, highlight key behaviors, and uncover insights that might otherwise
remain hidden. Moreover, effective visuals are invaluable for communicating
results to collaborators, stakeholders, or non-expert audiences in a clear and
compelling way.

In the case of DualSPHysics, there are several approaches to visualize simulation
results, depending on the purpose and level of detail required. For quick and
efficient analysis, ParaView provides a user-friendly interface and powerful
tools to interactively explore the data. On the other end of the spectrum, more
sophisticated workflows can involve exporting simulation data into Blender, where
ray tracing and advanced rendering techniques allow for the creation of
high-quality, cinematic visuals. In this section, we'll cover a range of
available options — from the simple to the stunning — to help you choose the
best tools for your visualization needs.
