# The Inductiva Guide to CaNS
Your resource hub for all things CaNS at Inductiva. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to seamlessly run your CaNS simulations on Cloud machines equipped with hundreds of cores and terabytes of disk space.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check!

## About CaNS
[CaNS](https://github.com/CaNS-World/CaNS) (Canonical Navier-Stokes) is a high-performance simulator for massively-parallel numerical simulations of fluid flows. It is specifically designed to solve problems involving incompressible, Newtonian fluids, making it a popular choice for researchers and engineers in fluid dynamics. CaNS is widely used in simulations of turbulence, vortex dynamics, and large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.
