<h3>About CaNS</h3>

[CaNS](https://github.com/CaNS-World/CaNS) (Canonical Navier-Stokes) is a high-performance simulator for massively-parallel numerical simulations of fluid flows. It is specifically designed to solve problems involving incompressible, Newtonian fluids, making it a popular choice for researchers and engineers in fluid dynamics. CaNS is widely used in simulations of turbulence, vortex dynamics, and large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.
