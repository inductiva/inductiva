# Run Your First Simulation
This tutorial will show you how to run CaNS simulations using the Inductiva API. 

We will cover the `closed_box` use case from the examples available on the [official CaNS documentation](https://github.com/CaNS-World/CaNS), to help you get started with simulations.

## Prerequisites
1. Download the required files [here](https://github.com/CaNS-World/CaNS/tree/v2.4.0/examples/closed_box) and save them to a folder named `SimulationFiles`.
2. In the `SimulationFiles` folder, create a new folder named `data`. The simulator writes files to this folder and will encounter an error if it is not present.

## Running a CaNS Simulation
Here is the code required to run a CaNS simulation using the Inductiva API:

```python
"""CaNS example."""
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-16",
	spot=True)

# Initialize the Simulator
cans = inductiva.simulators.CaNS(\
    version="2.4.0")

# Run simulation
task = cans.run(input_dir="/Path/to/SimulationFiles",
    sim_config_filename="input.nml",
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

> **Note**: `spot` machines are a lot cheaper but may be terminated by the provider if necessary.

To adapt the code for this or any other use case, simply replace `input_dir` with the path to your CaNS input files and 
set the `sim_config_filename` accordingly.

When the simulation is complete, we terminate the machine, download the results and print a summary of the simulation as shown below.

```
Task status: Success

	Size of unzipped output:  203.68 MB

```

As you can see in the "In Progress" line, the part of the timeline that represents the actual execution of the simulation, 
the core computation time of this simulation was approximately 126.3 seconds (around 2 minutes).

It's that simple!
