# ⚙️ Test Your Inductiva Setup 
Before diving into tutorials and benchmarks, let's ensure that your Inductiva Python package is properly set up. To confirm everything is working as expected, simply run a quick SWAN simulation — it only takes a few seconds!

## Step 1: Copy and Run the Code
To get started, copy the code below and paste it into a Python script.

When you run the script, all the necessary simulation artifacts and configuration files will be automatically downloaded to your computer. The SWAN simulation will then be sent to a cloud machine for execution.

```python
"""SWAN example."""
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-4",
    spot=True)

# Download the input files into a folder
input_dir = inductiva.utils.files.download_from_url(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/inductiva-api-demo-files/"
    "swan-input-example.zip", True)

# Initialize the Simulator
swan = inductiva.simulators.SWAN()

# Run simulation
task = swan.run( \
    input_dir=input_dir,
    sim_config_filename="a11refr.swn",
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()

task.print_summary()
```

## Step 2: Verify the Task Status
After the simulation completes, a task summary will be displayed in your terminal. If the task status shows **Success**, congratulations! You've successfully run a SWAN simulation.

You're ready to start running simulations seamlessly!
