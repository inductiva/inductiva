## About SWAN
[SWAN](https://swanmodel.sourceforge.io) (Simulating WAves Nearshore) is a numerical wave model designed to simulate the propagation and transformation 
of waves in coastal and nearshore areas. It is widely used in coastal 
engineering, oceanography, and environmental studies to predict wave 
patterns and interactions with the shoreline.

## Container Images
Each version of SWAN in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=swan), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/swan).
