## About SWAN
[SWAN](https://swanmodel.sourceforge.io) (Simulating WAves Nearshore) is a numerical wave model designed to simulate the propagation and transformation 
of waves in coastal and nearshore areas. It is widely used in coastal 
engineering, oceanography, and environmental studies to predict wave 
patterns and interactions with the shoreline.
