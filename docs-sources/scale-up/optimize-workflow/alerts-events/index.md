# ðŸ”” Alerts & Events

Inductiva provides a flexible alert system to keep users informed about important events in their simulations and account activity. Alerts can notify of issues that require attention, or confirm that expected events have occurred.
There are two types of alerts:
- **Inductiva Alerts** â€“ predefined by Inductiva to warn users about events that could disrupt your work.
- **Simulation Observer Events** â€“ user-defined alerts that notify users of specific events in their simulations.

Depending on the alert type, notifications may be sent by email, shown in the web Console, or both. The table below lists all Inductiva alerts, their purpose, and the communication channels through which they can be received.
