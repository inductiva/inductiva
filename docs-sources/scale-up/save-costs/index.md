# Save Costs

## Get started
ðŸ’° The Save Costs section provides practical strategies to make the most of your credits 
on Inductivaâ€™s platform. It covers ways to reduce compute time and cloud storage usage, 
explains how to delete unnecessary task outputs, and shows how to identify the most 
cost-effective machines for your simulations. Whether you're running small academic 
experiments or large-scale production simulations, this section helps you avoid waste and 
optimize your budget.

| Choose the right computational resource for your simulation for optimal cost efficiency. | Save Storage Cost by deleting unnecessary data. | Save Storage Cost by reducing data generated in simulations. | 


## Why it's Useful
âœ“ **Lower your simulation expenses:** Learn how to minimize compute and storage costs.

âœ“ **Use the right machines:** Choose faster or cheaper machines based on benchmarks and usage.

âœ“ **Keep storage clean:** Remove old, failed, or unnecessary task outputs in bulk.

âœ“ **Spot big spenders:** Identify tasks or projects that consume excessive storage.

âœ“ **Develop efficient habits:** Adopt cost-saving practices that scale as your usage grows.
