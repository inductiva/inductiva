# Projects

The Inductiva API uses Projects as the primary organizational unit for grouping related Tasks, providing a clean way to manage collections of simulations under a common folder.


## Get started
Learn about _Projects_ — the organizational framework in the Inductiva API that groups your simulation tasks logically. Projects provide structure, organization, and simplified management for your computational workflows.

| **[Projects →](tasks.md)** | **[Manage Projects →](tasks-execution.md)** | **[Visualize Project →](tasks-lifecycle.md)** |
|---|---|---|
| Learn about Projects and how to create them | Manage tasks within projects and organize your simulation workflows | Understand the task's status state machine, from submission through completion |

## Features
✓ **Automatic organization** Every task belongs to a project — either one you specify or the default project. No orphaned simulations, everything stays organized from the start.

✓ **Flexible grouping** Group related simulations by experiment, parameter sweep, research topic, or any logical structure that fits your workflow.

✓ **Unified task management** View and manage all tasks within a project from a single interface. Track progress across related simulations and identify patterns in your computational work.

✓ **Simple task assignment** Add tasks to projects either during submission or after. Flexible assignment lets you organize work as your research evolves.
