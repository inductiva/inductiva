# Benchmark
The Inductiva API provides a benchmarking tool to help you measure, compare, and optimize simulation performance across different configurations. Make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, cost optimization, and performance tuning.

## Get started
Learn about _Benchmarks_ — the class in the Inductiva API for systematically evaluating simulation performance across different machine types, configurations, and parameters.

| **[Benchmarks →](benchmarking.md)** | **[Run a Benchmark →](run-benchmarks.md)** | **[Check Progress & Results →](monitor-live.md)** |
|---|---|---|
| Learn about Benchmarks and how you can use them to find the optimal simulation configuration. | Follow a step-by-step tutorial to set up, execute, and optimize your first benchmark. | Track benchmark progress, visualize results, and make informed decisions using the Inductiva Console. |

## Why it’s Useful
✓ **Compare machine types** Systematically evaluate different computational resources to find the best price-performance ratio for your simulations.

✓ **Measure performance metrics** Track execution time, cost, and other key performance indicators across multiple runs.

✓ **Parallel execution** Run multiple benchmark configurations simultaneously to reduce evaluation time and get faster insights.

✓ **Export results** Export benchmark data in JSON or CSV formats for further analysis, and decision-making.

✓ **Automatic recommendations** Get recommendations for optimal machine configurations.
