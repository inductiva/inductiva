# Recipes

## Get started
⏩ The Recipes section provides practical, ready-to-use code examples that help you 
get things done faster on the Inductiva platform. Whether you want to automate simulation 
clean-up, manage storage more efficiently, or interact with tasks and projects through 
the CLI or Python API, these examples show you how. They’re lightweight, tested, and built 
to be easily adapted to your specific needs. Perfect for both beginners and advanced users 
looking to streamline their workflow!

This section is an ever-growing collection of useful scripts, so here's a few top highlights:

| **[Reuse input files →](reuse-files.md)** | **[Reuse output files →](reuse-files.md#how-to-reference-output-files)** | **[Clean-up Storage →](storage-related/index.md)** | 
|---|---|---|
| Instead of uploading large inout files repeatedly, upload files once and reuse them across multiple tasks. | Reuse the output of a previous task as input of a new simulation. | This guide shows how to identify and clean up unnecessary storage. |
