# üóëÔ∏è Clean Up Storage by Condition

As you run more simulations on Inductiva, storage used by failed, outdated, or large tasks can accumulate quickly, potentially <a href="https://inductiva.ai/guides/how-it-works/basics/how-much-does-it-cost">increasing costs</a> and cluttering your project space. This guide shows you how to identify and clean up unnecessary storage by:

* [Deleting failed](sections/delete-failed-tasks.md)
* [Deleting old tasks](sections/delete-old-tasks.md)
* [Cleaning up storage for entire projects](sections/delete-project-tasks.md)
* [Deleting unwanted/temporary files from a simulation](sections/delete-unwanted-files.md)
* [Downloading outputs before deletion](sections/download-and-delete.md)
* [Identifying tasks that use the most storage](sections/find-large-tasks.md)

Each section provides a code snippet to help you manage your storage effectively and keep your workspace organized.
