# The Inductiva Guide to CP2K ⚛️
Your resource hub for all things CP2K at Inductiva. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced user, you'll find the resources you need to speed up your CP2K simulations by sending them to Cloud machines with hundreds of cores or to top-tier Cloud GPUs.

Inductiva simplifies research by making high-performance computing more accessible and cost-effective. Use the power of the Cloud to **scale your simulations** and **finish your projects sooner**, while keeping your costs in check!

## About CP2K
[CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/about) is a model designed for atomistic and molecular simulations of solid-state, liquid, molecular, and biological systems. It targets massively parallel and linear scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations.
