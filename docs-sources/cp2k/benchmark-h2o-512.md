## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This benchmark evaluates the performance of the **CP2K** simulator by running an **ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)** simulation of liquid water.  
The test is based on the standard **H2O-64** benchmark from CP2K but extended to **H2O-512** (512 water molecules, 1536 atoms, 4096 electrons) to better leverage **cloud scalability**.

### Why H2O-512?

The **H2O-64** benchmark is designed for local runs or small clusters.  
However, when scaling to **high-performance cloud environments**, its small size underutilizes resources and fails to stress-test parallel performance.  
Thus, we use **H2O-512** to:

- Test **scaling efficiency** on multiple cores
- Measure **cost-performance trade-offs** on the cloud  
- Better simulate real-world production workloads

### Software Versions
The software versions used in this benchmark were the following:

| Component              | Version                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| cp2k                  | 2025.1                                |
| MPI                  | OpenMPI v4.1.6              |
| Operating System       |Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS|
| kernel                 | 6.8.0-65-generic                     |

> **Note:**  
> Results for **local machines** and certain cloud configurations with **16 vCPUs** are **intentionally omitted**.  
> The **H2O-512 benchmark** represents a **large-scale simulation** (1536 atoms, 4096 electrons) that demands significant computational power and memory.  
> - On **local machines** and some **16-vCPU instances**, the **available memory** is insufficient to complete the simulation.  


## âš¡ Results

We evaluated performance across multiple configurations, comparing execution times and analyzing the **cost vs runtime** trade-off.

### 1. Execution Times Comparison

This plot shows how the total runtime of the simulation varies across different configurations.

### 2. Cost vs Time

This plot compares the **execution cost** against the **simulation runtime**, helping identify the **sweet spot** between **speed** and **cost efficiency**.

```

> **Note:**
> The plot shows a significant increase in both cost and simulation time when moving from the `c4-highcpu-144` to the `c4-highcpu-192`. This may be due to the fact that C4 machines can be equipped with one of two CPU typesâ€”[Granite Rapid or Emerald Rapid](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#c4_series). The slower simulation is likely running on a different CPU architecture, which could explain the large performance difference.

## ðŸš€ Conclusions

- **H2O-512** is better suited than **H2O-64** for **cloud-based scaling benchmarks**.
- Execution time decreases **non-linearly** with more compute resources.
- Optimal performance depends on balancing **time-to-results** with **cost**.
- These results provide guidance for selecting the right configuration based on **budget** and **deadline constraints**.
