## About CP2K
[CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/about) is a model designed for atomistic and molecular simulations of solid-state, liquid, molecular, and biological systems. It targets massively parallel and linear scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations.

## Supported Versions
Inductiva stays up to date with the latest versions of CP2K. Below is a list of the supported versions, along with their respective release dates:

## Container Images
Each version of CP2K in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=cp2k), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/cp2k).
