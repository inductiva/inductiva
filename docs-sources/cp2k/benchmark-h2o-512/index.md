## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This benchmark evaluates the performance of the **CP2K** simulator by running an **ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)** simulation of liquid water.  
The test is based on the standard **H2O-64** benchmark from CP2K but extended to **H2O-512** (512 water molecules, 1536 atoms, 4096 electrons) to better leverage **cloud scalability**.

### Why H2O-512?

The **H2O-64** benchmark is designed for local runs or small clusters.  
However, when scaling to **high-performance cloud environments**, its small size underutilizes resources and fails to stress-test parallel performance.  
Thus, we use **H2O-512** to:

- Test **scaling efficiency** on multiple cores
- Measure **cost-performance trade-offs** on the cloud  
- Better simulate real-world production workloads

## Computational Resources Tested

The benchmark was conducted on the following machine series:

### Intel-based
- **C2**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Cascade Lake)

- **C3**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Sapphire Rapids)

- **C4**  
  Intel Xeon Scalable (Granite Rapids) â€” latest generation

### AMD-based
- **C2D**  
  AMD EPYC (Rome)

- **C3D**  
  AMD EPYC (Genoa)

- **C4D**  
  AMD EPYC (Turin) â€” latest generation

### Notes on Machine Selection
- Some configurations were excluded due to **insufficient memory**:  
  - `c3d-highcpu-16`  
  - `c2d-highcpu-16`  
  - local test machines  
- For the **C2 series**, only the `standard` configuration was tested, as `highcpu` variants are not available.
