# Protein Solvation Scenario

The Protein Solvation Scenario models the dynamics of a protein solvated in water inside a cubic box using the GROMACS simulator. The system is modeled with motion equations for individual atoms, following the prescription of a molecular force field approximation.

To access all the visualization and post-processing features of this scenario, you need to install the extra dependencies for the molecules package with the following command: 

 ```bash 
 pip install --upgrade "inductiva[molecules_extra]"
 ``` 
Now, let's dive into an example!

### Example
To test this scenario, you can download directly a protein from the RCSB database using its PDB ID. For this example, let's consider insulin (PDB ID equal to 1ZNI).
Do not forget to insert your API Key (check the [main page](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/tree/main#api-access-tokens) to see how to get one).

```python
import inductiva

inductiva.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Download the insulin protein (ID - "1ZNI") from RCSB database
insulin_pdb_file = inductiva.molecules.utils.download_pdb_from_rcsb(pdb_id="1ZNI")

# Initialize the scenario
scenario = inductiva.molecules.ProteinSolvation(
     protein_pdb = insulin_pdb_file,
     temperature = 300)

# Run a simulation
task = scenario.simulate(simulation_time_ns = 0.01, ignore_warnings = True)

# Get the simulation output on your local machine.
output = task.get_output()
 ```
This may take up to 2 minute, depending on which machine you use. 

## Scenario Configuration
To initialize the scenario, the user can define the following parameters:
- `protein_pdb` : PDB file containing the initial conformation of the protein;
- `temperature`: Temperature of the system in K.

Before simulation, files undergo automatic pre-processing in the backend to strip away all non-protein components of the system, such as ligands, non-standard residues, or water molecules, leaving only the protein.
We tested the scenario with structures predicted by the [AlphaFold2 model](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk) and structures from the [RCSB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org), but you can provide any other well-formatted PDB file as input, as long as its contains at least one protein chain with all its atoms coordinates. Please be aware that PDB files downloaded directly from RCSB may need extra preparation, other than removing non-protein elements, like filling in missing atoms. Our API doesn't handle this of pre-processing step, so you can use software like [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/) or [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) for this purpose.


The user can further define the following simulation parameters:
- `simulation_time_ns`: The simulation time, in nanoseconds. Default value is 10.
- `output_timestep_ps`: The time interval between recorded snapshots of the atom's positions in the trajectory output file, in picoseconds. Default value is 1.
- `integrator`: The integrator to use for the simulation.
    Options:
                - "md" ([Molecular Dynamics](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019/reference-manual/algorithms/molecular-dynamics.html)): Accurate leap-frog algorithm for
                integrating Newton's equations of motion.
                - "sd" ([Steepest Descent](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/algorithms/energy-minimization.html)): Stochastic dynamics integrator with
                leap-frog scheme.
                - "bd" ([Brownian Dynamics](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2021.2/reference-manual/algorithms/brownian-dynamics.html)): Euler integrator for Brownian or
                position Langevin dynamics.
    Default value if "md".
- `n_steps_min`: Number of steps for energy minimization. Default value is 5000.
- `ignore_warnings`: Whether to ignore warnings during grompp (gromacs preprocessor) step. If set to False, the simulation will fail if there are warnings. If True, the simulation will run and ignore the warnings, but the results may have inaccuracies. Use with caution. 

Moreover, the hardware can be defined and configured through `inductiva.resources.MachineGroup`, check the [machines section](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/tree/main/inductiva/resources#manage-computational-resources). Launching a simulation returns a task object, which can be used to verify the status of the simulation, get the simulation outputs and access post-processing tools. See more in [Tasks](inductiva/README.md).

## Output and Post-processing 
The simulation output folder contains trajectory data spanning the simulation duration and the protein's topology. These files are necessary to generate an interactive trajectory visualization using [NGLview](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview). Users have the flexibility to select the protein's representation type, including options to display or hide the backbone, and they can also specify the criteria for visualization selection. You can refer to the [documentation](https://nglviewer.org/ngl/api/manual/usage/selection-language.html) for guidance on creating custom selections according to your preferences. Currently, Inductiva's visualization tools for molecular dynamics only work in Jupyter Notebook environment.


```python
output.render_interactive(representation="ball+stick", add_backbone=True, selection="protein")
 ```

Users also have the option to plot the RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation) over the simulation for each residue within the protein structure. [RMSF](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/analysis/alignment_and_rms/rmsf.html) measures the extent to which a structure deviates from its average configuration over time, offering insights into the mobility of specific protein residues. 

```python
 rmsf_values = output.plot_rmsf_per_residue()
 ```

</p>

Furthermore, you have the capability to visualize attributes for each amino acid, including metrics like RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation), or any other properties that you compute independently.

```python
output.render_attribute_per_residue(rmsf_values)
 ```

In the visualization of the RMSF colored protein backbone, the red parts represent residues with higher mobility.
