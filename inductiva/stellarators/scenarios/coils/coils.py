class StellaratorCoils(scenarios.Scenario):
    """Represents stellarator coils.

    A stellarator is a magnetic fusion confinement device that possesses a 
    set of external electromagnetic coils that have current running through 
    them. These coils create a magnetic field that is able to confine a plasma, 
    at extremely high temperatures, where the nuclear fusion reactions take 
    place.

    Therefore, designing a stellarator involves defining a set of 
    electromagnetic coils. This set of coils is defined by a small set of 
    NC independent coils, due to the symmetries involved. There is stellarator 
    symmetry, that mirrors this independent set of coils and then 'number of
    field periods (nfp)' rotational symmetry, that repeats this block of coils
    throughout the stellarator in the toroidal direction (the long way around
    the torus). The number of field periods is the number of complete magnetic 
    field repetitions within a device. It represents how many times the magnetic
    field repeats itself along the toroidal direction, lowering the number
    of independent coils that one has to design. Therefore, the total number
    of coils in a stellarator device comes out to 2*NC*nfp.

    For more information about stellarators, there are many articles with 
    very good information. Per Helander's 2014 "Theory of plasma confinement in 
    non-axisymmetric magnetic fields" is a good example. See more details at:
    https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/77/8/087001

    The class can be initialized normally (directly from __init__) providing
    a list of `Coil` objects or from the class methods so that the individual 
    coils can also be created before creating the StellaratorCoils object. 

    Attributes:
        coils (list): List of `Coil` objects.
        num_field_periods (int): Number of magnetic field periods.
          Refers to the number of complete magnetic field repetitions 
          within a stellarator. Represents how many times the magnetic
          field pattern repeats itself along the toroidal direction.
          Typically varies between 1 and 3.

        The magnetic field produced on the plasma surface and a set of objective
        functions are computed for a collection of stellarator coil 
        configurations with the goal of optimizing a stellarator design.

        The optimization is performed as follows:
        1. The scenario's coil configuration is used as an initial 
          configuration.
        2. Gaussian noise is added to each coil parameter to produce 
          `num_sample` configurations.
        3. From these configurations, the one with the lowest value of the
          objective functions is selected.
        4. This configuration is then used as an initial configuration for
          the next iteration.
        5. The process is repeated `num_iteration` times.

        The simulation also outputs the Fourier Series coefficients describing
        the coils for each of the configurations obtained during the process.
