                temporary or unwanted files generated during the simulation.
                This helps reduce storage usage by discarding unnecessary
                output.
                - If a string is provided, it is treated as the path to a shell
                script that must be included with the simulation files.
                - If a list of strings is provided, each item is treated as an
                individual shell command and will be executed sequentially.
                All cleanup actions are executed in the simulation's working
                directory, after the simulation finishes.
