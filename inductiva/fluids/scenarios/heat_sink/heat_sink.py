    """Heat sink scenario.

    This is a simulation scenario for a heat sink. A heat source is placed
    in a box where there is an air flow. A heat sink, placed on top of the
    source, is used to dissipate the heat via convection with the air flow.

    The heat source is modeled as a heater with a given power. The heat sink
    is a block of aluminum with thin fins on top. The air flow is introduced
    in the simulation via an inlet, where the air is at a fixed temperature.

    The scenario is simulated in a 3D box with dimensions 8 x 16 x 52 cm in x, y
    and z directions, respectively. The heat sink is a 4 x 3 x 6 cm block
    centered in (x, z) in the simulation box. The sink has 1 mm wide fins
    elongated along the z direction and separated by 2 mm centered in the x
    direction. The heat source is a 1 x 1 x 1 cm cube that sits under the heat
    sink. The air flow is injected in the simulation from the lower z boundary,
    and flows in the positive z direction.

    Schematic representations of the simulation scenario:

    - as seen from the side (zy plane): z points right, y points up, x points
      into the screen.
