**Authors**: Manuel Madeira, David Carvalho

In this tutorial, we delve into the problem of ... ðŸ”¥ **heat diffusion** on a plate! ðŸ”¥

We will take you step by step up to a point where you can gauge the potential of Neural Networks
-- in both strength and versatility -- in solving Partial Differential Equations:

1. **The Heat Equation**: introduces the physics behind heat diffusion.

2. **Finite-Differences**: classical numerical routine to approximate its solution across a 2D plate.

3. **Physics-Inspired Neural Network**: with that estimate of the solution as a *benchmark*, see how **Machine-Learning algorithms** fare for the same situation, by deploying a PINN
(Physics-Inspired Neural Network).

4. **Generalized Neuro-Solver***: explore further into how versatile these Neural Networks are in
handling **more complex geometries** than the 2D domain and **varying
initial/boundary conditions**;

This field is fast-growing but, most importantly is at its *blissful infancy* stage.
Our dream, rooted in a belief, is that Machine Learning may be refined to excel
in extremely complex and customizable cases.

This sophistication could potentially fare better in performance than
every other classical solver, allowing us to go to lands classical frameworks have never
granted us so far!

Alright. ðŸ”¥ *Let's get hot in here!* ðŸ”¥

## The Heat Equation: a warm-up

Everybody has an elementary feeling for what heat is. *Heat diffusion* is the
process through which energy is transported in space due to gradients in
temperature.

These considerations are reflected mathematically in the so-called *Heat
Equation*, which sets how the temperature $u(t, \mathbf{r})$ at a
point in space $\mathbf{r}$ and time instant $t$ evolves.
It must satisfy:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u (t, \mathbf{r})}{\partial t} - D \Delta u(t, \mathbf{r}) = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

The thermal diffusivity $D$ controls how fast heat can spread around a
neighborhood.
For more realistic (and oftentimes less structured) media, their specifics
result in a *local* diffusity $D(t, \mathbf{r})$.
In the *Heat* series, we consider homogeneous media, for which $D$ is
constant throughout.

Now, what about $\Delta$  --- the *Laplacian* operator? Let's see how it acts
on a function $u$:

$$
\Delta u = \nabla \cdot (\nabla u) = \sum_{i} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial {r_i}^2}
$$

So we have $n$ $2^\rm{nd}$-order partial spatial derivatives to account for
but also a single $1^\rm{st}$-order partial derivative in time.
That's a large batch of **differential operators** right there. We can lump
them into a single *differential operator* which governs the evolution of the
solution we're after:

$$
\mathcal{L} \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}, \frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2_{r_1}}, \dots \frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2_{r_n}} \right] u(t, \mathbf{r}) = 0
$$

Alright --- no doubt we're in the presence of a **Partial Differential Equation**.

*These beasts are not easy to tame*. However, throughout the *Heat*
series, we exploit the structural simplicity of the Heat Equation --- alongside
the fact it is both very intuitive to understand and easy to set up meaningfully.

### Heating across a 2D square plate

We'll guide you on how to solve this equation in a simple yet realistic
geometric setup: across a *2-dimensional plate* of variable size [2].

As you will soon see, this domain is simple enough not only to allow
intuitive visualization but also to provide the possibility of adding extra
complexity without much effort.

So let's have a go. Our spatial vector in 2 dimensions is
$\mathbf{r} = (x, y)$ and so the heat equation takes the form:

$$
\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - D \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x ^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y ^2} \right) \right]u(t,x,y)= 0
$$

From a computational point of view, it will do us a favor to think in terms of
the result upon applying each differential operator to the solution:

$$
\begin{equation}
u_t - D \left( u_{xx} + u_{yy} \right) = 0  \label{HE_2D}
\end{equation}
$$

where the partial derivatives are shorthanded to, say,
$\partial_{x} \equiv \partial / \partial x$ and
$\partial_{xx} = \partial_{x} \partial_{x}$.

But hold on! We can't start solving this beast just yet...

### Setting boundary and initial conditions

We need more information to formulate completely this PDE.
**Initial and boundary conditions** ensure that a *unique* solution exists
by the function at particular points $(t,x,y)$ of the input
space.

These are normally reasoned through intuition and hindsight.
Throughout the *Heat* series, we employ *Dirichlet boundary conditions*, which
ensure:

- through the *initial condition*, that a certain temperature is fixed
across *all* points on the plate at the initial time instant (when $t=0$).
We'll take $ u(0, x, y) = -1 ^\mathrm{o}C  $.

- through the the *boundary conditions*, that a temperature is fixed at *all*
times *only* for points along the 4 edges of the plate (top, bottom, left and right).
    - We choose the energy source to act as to get the top edge to some hot
    temperature. We'll take $u(t, x, y_\mathrm{max}) = 1 ^\mathrm{o}C \ .$
    - The remaining edges are held at some cold temperature. We'll take
      $\underbrace{u(t, x, y_\mathrm{min})}_{\text{Bottom}} = \underbrace{u(t, x_{\mathrm{min}}, y)}_{\text{Left}} =  \underbrace{u(t, x_\mathrm{max}, y)}_{\text{Right}} = -1 ^\mathrm{o}C \ .$

### Classical Numerical Methods

As usual, finding governing equations from first principles is actually the
easy part. Rather, solving them presents us major challenges. Why?

**Most PDEs do not admit analytical, pen-and-paper solutions.** Only a handful of
cherry-picked differential operators can give rise to closed-form solutions.
*Lesson learnt* --- **numerical approximations** must be used.

> But which ones? In which conditions? For what type of PDE?

These are general and difficult questions to answer.
Wildly different methods have been curated by the computationally-inclined
in the Mathematical and Physical communities --- not as recipes set on stone
but rather frameworks prone to constant scrutiny.

*Mesh-based methods* are traditionally the dominant approaches. The main idea
is to **discretize** the domain of interest into a set of mesh points and,
with them, approximate the solution. A whole zoo of methods exists,
in particular:

- **Finite Differences Methods (FDMs)** replace the PDE expression with a
discretized analogue along a grid with the aid of *function differences*.
- **Finite Elements Methods (FEMs)** subdivide the problem domain in multiple
elements and apply the equations to each one of them.
- **Finite Volume Methods (FVMs)** builds a solution approximation based on the
exact computation (taking advantage of the divergence theorem) of the average
value of the solution function in each of the smaller sub-volumes in which the
domain is partitioned.

All these methods have their advantages
and shortcomings given the idiosyncrasies of each PDE and setup of the problem.
Sometimes they may even coincide --- for some simple scenarios
(such as regular grids) FEMs and FDMs *might* end up being the same [1].

Typically, mesh-based classical routines tend to be very efficient in
low-dimensional problems on regular geometries. We will then use this
convenience to our advantage by applying **a FDM in a FTCS (Forward in Time,
Centered in Space) scheme.**
