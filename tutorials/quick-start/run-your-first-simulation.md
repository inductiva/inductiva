# Run Your First Simulation with Inductiva

Welcome to Inductiva! Now that youâ€™ve completed the [onboarding process](https://console.inductiva.ai/), itâ€™s time to dive in and see how easy it is to run your first simulation!

Make sure you have an active Inductiva account. [Sign up here](https://console.inductiva.ai/) if you donâ€™t have one.

In this first example tutorial, weâ€™ll:
* Run a fluid dynamics simulation to model water flow in a 2D domain.
* Use an X cloud machine made available through our platform.
* Analyze the results to understand the flow pattern and behavior.

Letâ€™s get started!
