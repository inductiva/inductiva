# Welcome to the Inductiva API Tutorials

Here you will find in-depth guides explaining how to use the Inductiva API. These tutorials add to the information snippets available in the [official API documentation](https://docs.inductiva.ai/en/latest/) by providing more detailed step-by-step instructions to achieve certain practical goals.

* [Generating Synthetic Data for training Physics-ML models](generating-synthetic-data/synthetic-data-generation-1.md). Synthetic data helps us teach machine learning models without needing real-world data for every scenario, and without directly embedding the physical law for it. Instead, we use physical simulators that mimic real-world dynamics under various simulated conditions to produce data that inherently reflects these laws, helping the model learn on its own. This tutorial series will walk you through the process of generating such synthetic training datasets to enable your ML models to learn complex physics. Weâ€™ll show you how to use the Inductiva API to generate synthetic data at scale and in an enconomically vaiable way.
