In this guide, we will cover how to set up and run GROMACS simulations, 
a versatile molecular dynamics simulator built into the Inductiva API.

We will cover:

- Configuring GROMACS simulations with the necessary input files.
- Example code to help you get started with simulations.

# GROMACS

GROMACS is widely used for simulating biochemical molecules like proteins, 
lipids, and nucleic acids, but its speed and efficiency make it suitable 
for a range of non-biological systems, including polymers and fluid dynamics.

A typical GROMACS simulation consists of several stages: preparing the 
molecular structure, energy minimization, running the simulation, and 
analyzing the results. Youâ€™ll need multiple input files to configure and 
run your simulation, and specific GROMACS commands will be used to carry 
out each step.

## Example Code

In the following example, we run a basic molecular dynamics simulation 
of water molecules in a small box:

```{literalinclude} ../../examples/gromacs/gromacs.py
:language: python
```
