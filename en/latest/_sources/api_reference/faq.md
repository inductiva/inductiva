# FAQs

**What should I do if Inductiva does not support the simulation package I need?**

*If the simulation package you wish to use is not supported by Inductiva, please 
reach out to our support team for assistance at support@inductiva.ai.*

**How do I resolve authentication problems with the Inductiva API?**

*Authentication issues typically arise from invalid credentials or expired tokens. 
Double-check your credentials and refresh your API tokens. For further assistance, 
our support team is ready to help.*

**What can I do if I reach my resource allocation limits?**

*If you've hit your quota for computational resources, consider reviewing your 
current usage. To request an increase in your resource quotas, please reach out 
to support@inductiva.ai.*

**The simulation package I want to use isn't supported. What are my options?**

**How can I fix configuration errors in my simulation setup?**

**What should I do about dependency conflicts?**

**How can I optimize the performance of my simulations?**
Performance optimization involves adjusting simulation parameters and choosing
the most appropriate processing option. For that, you should try running your
simulation using the several types of 
[computational resources](../intro_to_api/computational-infrastructure.md)
available via the API, and also check our
[official benchmarks page](https://benchmarks.inductiva.ai/),
where we compare the performance of running specific simulation use cases
over several computational resources.
