# Troubleshooting Guide
In this troubleshooting section, we aim to guide you through resolving issues 
related to incorrect or incomplete installation of the Inductiva package
or its dependencies. This guide assumes youâ€™ve gone through all steps we've shared 
in the [installation tutorial](../get_started/installation.md), and have faced
some issues.

If you find bugs, need help, or want to talk to the developers, reach out to us on

## Installation Failures
If you encounter issues installing the Inductiva API package, there are several 
steps you can take:

### Ensure you have a working pip
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```
### Use virtualenv or venv to isolate dependencies

If installing the package fails, you can retry it on a new Python virtual environment. 
A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) allows you to 
have a fresh Python environment with isolated dependencies. 

In your shell, run:

```
python -m venv <venv>
```

In that command, you should replace `<venv>` with the path (*e.g.*, `.venv`) in 
which you would like to create the environment. Then, to activate the environment 
(again, correctly replacing `<venv>`), run:

For `bash`/`zsh`:

```
source <venv>/bin/activate
```

For `cmd.exe` (Windows):

```
<venv>\Scripts\activate.bat
```

For `PowerShell` (Windows):
```
<venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can install the package as described 
below:

```
pip install --upgrade inductiva
```
