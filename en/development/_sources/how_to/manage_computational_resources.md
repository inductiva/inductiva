# Manage Computational Resources

Once you have launched your computational resources, there are a few API methods
that help manage them and see their status. Let's go over them one by one.

## Get your active computational resources

In case computational resources have been launched in another Python session and
want to manage or re-use them in another script, users can fetch the respective
instance via the `get` method as follows:

```python
## Obtain a list with instances of all active computational resources
>>> resources_list = inductiva.resources.machine_groups.get()
>>> print(resources_list)
[MPICluster(name="api-23zssj6oq77xxsot3o0nhax3d"),
 ElasticMachineGroup(name="api-45fetsr58okcs0x6j9m0vsi2z"),
 MachineGroup(name="api-4kken08fnoxuu5zjjak6ak2xe")]
```

## List your active computational resources

When you just want to check the active resources you can quickly list the
information of each one either via Python or via the CLI.

**Python**
```python
inductiva.resources.machine_groups.list()
```

**CLI**
```bash
$ inductiva resources list
```

One obtains for example the following information:
```
Active Resources:

       NAME                                MACHINE TYPE         ELASTIC         TYPE           # MACHINES         DATA SIZE IN GB         SPOT         STARTED AT (UTC)
       api-23zssj6oq77xxsot3o0nhax3d       c2d-highmem-16       False           mpi            3                  70                      False        01 Feb, 12:30:06
       api-45fetsr58okcs0x6j9m0vsi2z       c2-standard-4        True            standard       1/5                70                      False        01 Feb, 12:25:54
       api-4kken08fnoxuu5zjjak6ak2xe       c2-standard-8        False           standard       2                  60                      True         01 Feb, 12:26:37
```

## Terminate the active computational resources

When you have finished using your computational resources, don't forget to terminate
them. An advantage of Inductiva API is to control your computational
resources and avoid them being idle.

Hence, you can either terminate your computational resources via Python or the CLI. 

In Python, you will need to instantiate the computational resource object, for
example, with the `get` method and then do `machine.terminate()` for example. 

Via CLI, this process is much easier and you can either terminate a machine on
at a time:
```bash
inductiva resources terminate api-45fetsr58okcs0x6j9m0vsi2z
```

Or terminate them all at once. You will need to confirm this action:
```bash
inductiva resources terminate --all
```

Both are a blocking call that will only finish when the machines have terminated,
in this way no computational resources are left up.
